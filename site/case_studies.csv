Right now, we are engaging in creating a groundswell against corruption,  both working with the government to reduce red tape as also with citizens to  build up their courage and helping them to overcome corruption. We believe that  corruption has grown this big only because as citizens, we have tolerated it.  If we actively oppose it and there are enough of us, the government has to  buckle down and tackle the problem effectively.

With the ipaidabribe.com data, it was evident that there  was a flourishing market for bribes in land transactions, reflecting admirably  the laws of supply and demand! Those Sub Registrar offices that were on the periphery  of the city, where much of the new growth occurs, were seeing thegreatest rates of  bribes, whereas those Sub Registrar Offices which were in the heart of the city,  where land transactions are less frequent, were seeing fewer touts and lower rates.  So we made a proposal to the Department of Stamps and Registration – given that  all land transactions had been converted to electronic records, why not make them  ‘Anywhere Registration’? That is, one could go to any Sub Registrar office in the  city to register one’s land transaction.

",Tools,"The ipaidabribe.com idea has emerged and evolved over time. It commenced  with a discussion between co-founders of Janaagraha, Swati and Ramesh  Ramanathan and Mr. Sridar Iyengar, a board member of Janaagraha’s advisory  board a couple of years back regarding the pernicious effect of corruption  on destroying city life and disempowering citizens. The original idea was  that the website could become a simple means of tracking the market price  of corruption - a kind of market price prediction mechanism. A small  experimental website was put up to test the idea. However the afterthought  was that such an effort was indeed a very powerful one. Over time, we worked  on the idea extensively and added a lot more features. We decided that the  website has to be a multifaceted site, providing a variety of services to  people. We launched the new completely redesigned website on Aug 15, 2010,  India’s Independence day.  <br/> IPaidABribe.com (IPAB) is an initiative to tackle corruption by tapping  into the collective energy of citizens, almost every one of whom is either  a victim, perpetrator or beneficiary, or a combination of these. Janaagraha  has a very rigorous system of aligning its institutional objectives with  the performance of its programmes. Each institutional objective is further  aligned with several strategic themes. Ipab aligns with Janaagraha’s goal  of making a measurable difference in the quality of Citizenship in cities.  It does this by adopting the strategy of empowering citizens using a  net-plus- roots approach – we use a net based platform for recording the  grassroots experiences of citizens. Through this approach, ipaidabribe.com  aligns completely with Janaagraha’s key thrust of increasing the number of  citizen change agents in the city. We believe that every citizen who reports  a story on our website about paying a bribe, is angry enough to begin to  resist it. Of course, it goes without saying that somebody who has resisted  paying a bribe and reported the story, is already very much on the path of  being a citizen change agent.

Propeller Health,http://propellerhealth.com/,Private,"Propeller Health is a mobile platform for respiratory health management  designed to help patients and their physicians better understand and control  respiratory disease to reduce preventable emergency room visits and hospitalizations. <br/> Propeller applies data to solve one of the most pressing public health concerns  – asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) – including sharing data,  putting data in the hands of patients, leveraging aggregated and anonymous data and  linking health data to place. Through sensors, mobile apps and services, Propeller  aims to reduce the cost of care while delivering better quality of life for individuals  with chronic respiratory disease. Asthma and COPD diseases are unique in that patients  carry their inhalers with them and use them at the time and place when they have symptoms.  The sensor is a small device that attaches to the top of the existing inhaler and can be used with both rescue and controller medications for tracking symptoms and adherence  respectively. The objective data it collects, and the personalized feedback patients get as a result, can help them and their physicians to better understand and manage these  conditions by tracking how often they use their medication and by setting up medication  reminders and alerts.

Quora,https://www.quora.com/,Private,"Quora is a user-driven question-and-answer website. Quora is a Mountain View,  California based company that seeks to increase access to knowledge over the  internet. Quora is often contrasted to websites like Wikipedia, in that Quora  promotes the exchange of knowledge, while Wikipedia is a repository for  information. Whereas Wikipedia attempts to construct neutral, objective articles,  Quora allows individuals to offer their own personal perspective on any given issue.  Quora’s core function is the exchange of questions and answers: users post questions  to the broader Quora community, and these questions can then be answered by any  other Quora user with relevant knowledge to share. These answers are then “voted up”  or “voted down” by other users. This voting process allows the “best” answers to  achieve the widest circulation.
",,Education,"From a business perspective, Quora’s most significant challenge in the near  future will be monetizing its business and beginning to generate revenue.  To date, the company has relied exclusively on outside investment to finance  its operations. Quora will likely choose to monetize its site through advertising;  transitioning to an advertising-based model while not disrupting the user  experience will be a challenge for the company. <br/> Observers have offered a number of criticisms of Quora’s functionality  and culture: * Some have argued that Quora is dominated by an elite of early adopters,  who punish dissenting voices by downgrading their answers and through  bullying tactics. * Others have argued that Quora’s core Q&A format, though fantastic as  a research tool or as a way to share knowledge, is inherently less scale-able  than purely social platforms like Facebook or Twitter. People habitually make  use of these social networking sites, but are likely to turn to Quora only for  more specific needs. * Other users have criticized Quora’s policy of requiring smartphone users to  view Q&A threads through their mobile app, and not allowing access through  browsers. * In August 2012, Ivan Kirigin criticized Quora on his blog, Giant Robot  Lasers, pointing out that Quora published information on which questions users  viewed. Kirigin argued that this practice constituted a major invasion of  privacy, “What if the question were ‘How can I cope with newly discovered  cancer?’ Or, ‘Should I come out to my parents?’ Or, ‘What is the best way  to hide an affair?’” To Quora’s credit, it responded by discontinuing  this practice.

Quora’s essential value proposition, making it  easier for people to seek out and/or share specific human knowledge, is ultimately  difficult to quantify. It is safe to say however, that Quora has enabled people  to solicit the wisdom of highly specialized experts, and made it easier for people  with specific knowledge to share what they know.

Two years later, the volunteer-run organization  is still leveraging the power of crowdsoucing to provide post-Fukushima  radiation data, but has broadened its scope to provide baseline radiation data  and also measure other environmental factors like air quality. Due to the scale  of the disaster in Fukushima, the majority of the organization’s efforts are  still directed at providing granular radiation data so that those impacted by  the meltdown can make data-driven decisions. <br/> In the aftermath of the 9.0 magnitude earthquake and subsequent meltdown at  the Fukushima nuclear power plant, there was little publicly available data about  radiation levels in Japan. This dearth of radiation data concerned friends Sean  Bonner, Pieter Franken, and Joi Ito, all of whom had close ties to the region.  Geiger counters that enable radiation data collection were in short supply and  little official information about radiation levels was being shared with the  public. Spurred by the gap in readily available radiation data and the short  supply of Geiger counters, Bonner, Franken, and Ito took it upon themselves to  build the hardware they needed to monitor radiation levels in Japan. In  partnership with Tokyo Hackerspace, Safecast designed and built high quality  Geiger counters to enable citizens to collect radiation data within their  communities. <br/>  Constructing the hardware was one element of Safecast’s work. The other  component was assembling an expert network to help monitor the situation  unfolding in Japan. Within a week of the Fukushima disaster Safecast mobilized  a crowdsourced team of 25 experts committed to voluntarily monitor radiation  levels across Japan. This network quickly ballooned to include experts from  around the world, and Safecast rapidly grew to become the largest citizen  science monitoring network of its kind. This rapid growth can be attributed  to a number of factors, but most notably, it was the dearth of official  information on radiation levels that led to citizens creating their  own crowdsourced network.

The platform was designed to provide Americans with a new mechanism to submit  petitions to the Government regarding various issues.  In its first months of  operation, the threshold that a petition needed to reach in order to obtain an official response was of 5,000 signatures. Because of the quick and high rate  of participation in the portal the signature threshold was raised to a 100,000  signatures. The first official response to a petition created on We the People  was given one month after the launching of the site, and responded to a petition  to reduce the burden of student loans. In 2012, the source code for We the  People was published making it available for people all around the world who  wish to implement their own petitioning platform. The most popular content on  the Whitehouse.gov webpage was a response to the petition created in We the  People to start the construction of a “Death Star”, the military battle-station  of Star Wars. A petition submitted to the portal regarding the legalization  of unlocking cellphones was pushed forward by the White House, which resulted  in the Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act.

White House Open Government Initiative,http://www.whitehouse.gov/open,Government,"The Open Government Initiative is an initiative through Whitehouse.gov that  promotes transparency, collaboration, and participation in government. On December  8, 2009, President Barack Obama issued an Open Government (OpenGov) Directive  requiring all federal agencies to take immediate, specific steps to achieve  key milestones in transparency, participation, and collaboration throughout  his administration.
",,,,,,,,,,Ideas,Civic Responsibility,Allow anyone willing to participate to do so,Group of Experts,Website,United States,"Since President Obama put forth his directive in 2009, the administration has  stayed true to its commitment to building upon and expanding OpenGov. In 2013,  the administration put forth a second Open Government National Action Plan,  building on an earlier initiative to make government more transparent. Both  documents were published to help meet the standards of the Open Government  Project, an international agreement founded by the US and seven other  countries in 2011.
",,,,National,,,"On December 8, 2009 President Obama, in a memorandum to the Director of the  Office of Management & Budget, issued a directive for agency heads and  departments to implement principles of transparency, participation, and  collaboration with the public. The memorandum put forth 3 requirements that  agencies had to abide by: publish government information online, improve  quality of government information, create and institutionalize a culture of  open government, and create an enabling policy framework for open government.  Within these guidelines he included deadlines, and a framework for which each  agency must adopt an open government plan.

World Bank ICT4Gov,http://beta.ict4gov.org/,Non-profit,"The World Bank’s ICT4Gov initiative is a knowledge base for government  practitioners to share information and resources to encourage use of Information and  Communication Technologies (ICT) for better governance. The World Bank Institute is  facilitating such initiatives in a number of pilot participatory budgeting projects in  the Dominican Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
",,"Civic Participation, Governance, Transparency & Accountability",,,,,,,,Opinions,"Knowledge Building/Information Sharing, Community Building, Civic responsibility",Limit participation to a defined community,"Group of Experts, Voting","Mobile Application, Website, SMS Texts",,"In Democratic Republic of Congo, as of 2012, over 250,000 text messages have been sent throughout the different stages of this project. Since the beginning of the program, the provincial Kivu government reports an increasing capacity of the local government to better allocate resources, and communities involved have already seen an increase in the transfer of funds from the provincial to the local level. The preliminary results of an external evaluation suggest a reduction of tax evasion at the local level, with citizens more willing to pay taxes as they link government spending to improvement in the delivery of services. For the first time, communities such as Ibanda have gone from not having any investment budget to having 40% of their budget devoted to investments. The increase in the transfer of funds from the provincial to the local level has benefited communities, which now have more resources to deliver public services to the poor. For instance, the process has enabled the repair of 54 classrooms and a bridge in Luhindja, the founding of a health center and repair of a sewage system in Bagira, and the construction of a water fountain, as well as toilets in the local markets of Ibanda.To enhance these efforts, ICT4Gov is using mobile phones for four purposes. The first is to invite citizens to the participatory budgeting assemblies through geo-targeted SMS messages. These messages, reaching all the phones receiving signal from a particular tower, announce the date, time and location of the assemblies. Mobile phones are also being used for voting, allowing citizens to text a number associates with a particular project to identify which of the priorities they would like to see addressed in their community. When they have reached an agreement the local government devotes a percentage of the local investment budget to the project selected by the citizens. Additionally, mobile phones are being used to announce the voted decision, making the process more transparent and inclusive than ever before. Finally, mobile phones are being used to ask citizens about the projects that had been chosen. Through text messages, citizens are able to offer feedback and monitor the projects. By instituting a participatory budgeting initiative that uses simple SMS, rather than more advanced computing technologies, the World Bank and the Republic of Congo have been able to engage a larger portion of the population—women in particular.",,,,Regional,,Case-Studies,"The Dominican Republic is one of the few countries in the world to have  institutionalized through its Constitution participatory budgeting (PB), a  process in which non-elected citizens participate in the decision-making process  of budget allocation. The ICT4Gov program promotes the use of ICT as a means  to reinforce the inclusiveness and transparency of participatory budgeting processes  in the country, starting with two pilots in the Municipality of Bani and Jarabacoa.  Furthermore, working central government agencies and a broad coalition of national  stakeholders, ICT4Gov is currently developing a mobile enabled citizen feedback  mechanism to promote accountability and better delivery of public services.

XPRIZE,http://www.xprize.org/,Non-profit,"XPRIZEs are massive financial awards provided by the XPRIZE Foundation and a  variety of private sector sponsors for solutions to audacious problems. The  prizes are used to incentivize projects that could benefit humanity. Prizes  are given out following a competition, wherein individuals propose potential  projects or solutions to public problems. For example, the Ansari XPRIZE for  space exploration is one of the most famous examples of prize-induced contests. <br/> XPRIZEs are awarded in five different groups: Education, Energy and Environment, Exploration, Global Development and Life Sciences. Currently active XPRIZEs  include the Google Lunar XPRIZE, Archon Genomics XPRIZE presented by Express  Scripts, Qualcomm Tricorder XPRIZE and the Nokia Sensing XPRIZE. Already awarded  XPRIZEs include the Ansari XPRIZE, Progressive Insurance Automotive XPRIZE, Wendy  Schmidt Oil Cleanup XCHALLENGE and the Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander XCHALLENGE.
",,"Data/Technology, Economic Development, Education, Environment & Weather, Scientific Research","The scope and difficulty of XPRIZE challenges traditionally lead to teams or  organizations winning the prize, as was the case with the original Ansari XPRIZE.  However, considering the level of complexity involved in each challenge,  unaffiliated individuals could possibly provide useful input if given the  opportunity to collaborate, but the website provides no on-site means of  collaboration or team building.

The incredible success of the original Ansari XPRIZE—which  spawned over $100 million in development efforts by contestants—likely played  a significant role in catalyzing the wider use of price-induced contests and  challenges. XPRIZEs have “facilitated an oil recovery cleanup at quadruple the  standard rate. Enabled the creation of a 135 MPGe energy-efficient car. And  helped launch a $1.5 billion private space industry.”

Zooniverse,https://www.zooniverse.org/,,"Zooniverse is a website that houses the various projects run by the Citizen  Science Alliance. <br/> The Zooniverse website connects volunteers, or “zooites,” to a variety of  Citizen Science Alliance’s projects. The original project, Galaxy Zoo, had  volunteers classify galaxies by leading them through on online tutorial of  visual cues to determine galaxy type, testing the participant’s newly acquired  skills with a trial, and finally having the participants apply this knowledge  to unclassified galaxies. While the original Galaxy Zoo project is archived,  there have been several variations including two that are still in progress,  Galaxy Zoo, Hubble and Moon Zoo. <br/> In addition to Galaxy Zoo and its spin-offs, there are many other projects  that deal with astronomical categorization using the same technique of training  volunteers to identify certain characteristics and then use that knowledge to  classify specific celestial objects (galaxies, moons, etc.). The same model  is also utilized for projects in other fields such as ecology, climate science,  and marine biology. In the case of marine biology, the model was adjusted for a  project entitled Whale FM so that participants learned audio instead of visual  cues. There are also multiple transcription projects currently underway,  including Old Weather and Ancient Lives, which rely on volunteers to transcribe  documents. <br/> The Zooniverse/Citizen Science Alliance team determines which projects will  be housed in Zooniverse by having scientists submit proposals through online  questionnaires. Zooniverse works with scientists and scholars from a wide  variety of fields, including astronomy, humanities, climate science, planetary  science, classics, and ecology.
",,,,,"There are 22 projects which Zooniverse has run or is currently running. The  original Galaxy Zoo project produced millions of classifications. Each of  Zooniverse’s projects produces publications based on their findings, which  are available to users through the website.
