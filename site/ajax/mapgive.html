		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">When a catastrophic earthquake hit Haiti in 2010, map data critical for response efforts were  incomplete and hard to access. In a matter of days, hundreds of volunteers created the map for  Port au Prince in OpenStreetMap, greatly facilitating recovery efforts. <br/> High-quality geographic data helps organizations and communities make important environmental,  economic and disaster response decisions. In many places around the world, the information is  incomplete or non-existent. <br/> In open (or crowdsourced) mapping, volunteers work together to create a free and open map of the  world for purposes that range from mundane to critical. MapGive supports a global open mapping  initiative with learning tools, satellite imagery, technical services, event support and networks in  the global OpenStreetMap and humanitarian communities. <br/> MapGive is the U.S. State Department’s program for supporting OpenStreetMap. Contributors map infrastructure  data in OpenStreetMap, including the line of roads, building footprints, points of services and amenities,  land uses such as fields or industrial areas, and many other things. The Internet has many free maps, but  the underlying data in many maps are not available for public use due to legal and technical restrictions.  Through open mapping, anyone anywhere can sign up to learn mapping tools and start contributing, and anyone  can use the open map data. During humanitarian response, large numbers of volunteers divide up work through  the OSM Tasking Manager. <br/> Many entities work in the OpenStreetMap community, including governments, companies, non-profit organizations  and schools. The core infrastructure of OpenStreetMap (the servers, intellectual property and domain) is maintained  by the OSM Foundation, a non-profit organization based in the United Kingdom. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team  connects the OpenStreetMap community with groups working on humanitarian response and economic development.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The MapGive initiative began with Imagery to the Crowd, which offers high-resolution commercial satellite  imagery services in a format that volunteers can easily map into OpenStreetMap. With a focus on humanitarian  and development applications, MapGive is run by the State Department’s Humanitarian Information Unit. The unit  gives information to decisionmakers and partners in preparation for and response to humanitarian emergencies  worldwide. It also supports innovative technologies and best practices for humanitarian information management.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Challenges</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">OpenStreetMap is an extremely dynamic community, with a constantly evolving and growing number of actors, events, new communities  and related software projects. It takes an active learning approach to understand this landscape, build relationships and find ways  to contribute (and continue to contribute) as an institution. For instance,MapGive has worked closely with the Humanitarian  OpenStreetMap Team, mappers and other providers of imagery services to develop new processes and coordinate effectively when fulfilling  imagery requests. <br/> Sustaining volunteer engagement is another challenge; the Smithsonian Transcription Center shares the collective success  of volunteers as frequently as possible. Volunteers also have special behind-the-scenes access to curators and collections  managers, and they get first peeks at newly digitized collections. They also have the opportunity to share what they are  learning as they transcribe."
