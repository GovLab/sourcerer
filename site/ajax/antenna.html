		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">A web annotation tool that makes it easy for people to express themselves by  reacting to anything online – an article, a photo, a video, even a specific  snippet from a page. This tool uses an annotation plugin which allows people  to give feedback in the form of comments and reactions.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Historical Information</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Co-created by Porter Bayne, Tyler Brock and Eric Chaves, Antenna aims to  change the face of online conversation. After a successful beta test on news  site Hypervocal and (full disclosure) Latoya Peterson’s site, Racialicious,  Bayne, Brock and Chavs decided to revamp the overall design and user interface  in 2012. Created around the idea that all reader engagement is preceded by some  emotion or thought, the widget allows the user to express that emotion in their  reaction to content on a whole page or parts of a page online, encouraging  smarter use of information and participation, from shopping to public policy:  for example, how do we making ratings systems more accurate and more  self-descriptive (what does it mean to say a restaurant has 3 stars?).

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Challenges</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The biggest challenge for Antenna (before called ReadrBoard) is distinguishing itself from all the  other online user reaction tools. The developers must make the case for how  Antenna provides a higher quality of participation.
