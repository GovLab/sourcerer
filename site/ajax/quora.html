		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Quora is a user-driven question-and-answer website. Quora is a Mountain View,  California based company that seeks to increase access to knowledge over the  internet. Quora is often contrasted to websites like Wikipedia, in that Quora  promotes the exchange of knowledge, while Wikipedia is a repository for  information. Whereas Wikipedia attempts to construct neutral, objective articles,  Quora allows individuals to offer their own personal perspective on any given issue.  Quora’s core function is the exchange of questions and answers: users post questions  to the broader Quora community, and these questions can then be answered by any  other Quora user with relevant knowledge to share. These answers are then “voted up”  or “voted down” by other users. This voting process allows the “best” answers to  achieve the widest circulation.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Quora was founded in June 2009 by Adam D’Angelo and Charlie Cheever, and was  rolled out to the general public in June 2010. Both D’Angelo and Cheever were  employed at Facebook prior to the launch of Quora. The company was initially  financed by an $11 million investment from Benchmark Capital, a Venture Capital  firm specializing in tech-based startups (other recipients of Benchmark  investments include Instagram, Zipcar, Yelp, and Twitter). Quora currently has  102 employees, and has not yet monetized its service, choosing instead to  continue relying on outside investors. On 4/9/14, Quora received an additional  $80 million in funding, spearheaded by private equity firm and hedge fund Tiger  Global. Multiple sources have reported that Quora will likely turn to advertising  to generate revenue by 2015.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Challenges</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">From a business perspective, Quora’s most significant challenge in the near  future will be monetizing its business and beginning to generate revenue.  To date, the company has relied exclusively on outside investment to finance  its operations. Quora will likely choose to monetize its site through advertising;  transitioning to an advertising-based model while not disrupting the user  experience will be a challenge for the company. <br/> Observers have offered a number of criticisms of Quora’s functionality  and culture: * Some have argued that Quora is dominated by an elite of early adopters,  who punish dissenting voices by downgrading their answers and through  bullying tactics. * Others have argued that Quora’s core Q&A format, though fantastic as  a research tool or as a way to share knowledge, is inherently less scale-able  than purely social platforms like Facebook or Twitter. People habitually make  use of these social networking sites, but are likely to turn to Quora only for  more specific needs. * Other users have criticized Quora’s policy of requiring smartphone users to  view Q&A threads through their mobile app, and not allowing access through  browsers. * In August 2012, Ivan Kirigin criticized Quora on his blog, Giant Robot  Lasers, pointing out that Quora published information on which questions users  viewed. Kirigin argued that this practice constituted a major invasion of  privacy, “What if the question were ‘How can I cope with newly discovered  cancer?’ Or, ‘Should I come out to my parents?’ Or, ‘What is the best way  to hide an affair?’” To Quora’s credit, it responded by discontinuing  this practice.
