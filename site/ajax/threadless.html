		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Threadless was created in 2000 by two dropout students from Chicago, Jake Nickel and Jacob DeHart. After winning a design contest for the New Media Underground festival, Jake Nickel,  CEO of the company, partnered with a friend to create a design contest where people  could submit their original creations to be printed on a t-shirt . Nickel and his  Threadless co-founder, Jacob DeHart, used to be assiduous community members of  dreamless.org, an online discussion forum where designers and programmers interacted  with each other creating an online community where their members participated in collective tasks and discussed a series of communal topics. The idea of Threadless.com  was to create an activity to engage their peers in the process of creating “original” T-shirts as a fun hobby,  not to create a business.
