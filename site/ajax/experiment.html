		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Experiment.com is a crowdfunding site devoted to funding scientific research.  They are a self-described "mission-driven for-profit company" that provides a  platform for research scientists in the United States to crowdfund their  research projects.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Historical Information</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The project was launched in 2012 under the name Microryza by two University of  Washington graduates, Denny Luan and Cindy Yu, seeking to understand how the  Internet could be used to help fund scientific projects that are left behind by  the traditional grant funding model. The site relaunched as Experiment.com  in February 2014. <br/> Researchers submit their projects via the platform to be reviewed by the  Experiment team. After being approved, the project is uploaded in the  webpage. The researchers then share their projects to gain awareness and  crowdfund it. If the project reaches its funding goal, in the established  deadline, the money is transferred from the crowdfunders to the researchers.  Rather than provide funders with perks, a traditional part of crowdfunding,  funders of projects crowdfunded through Experiment get access to discussions  around the experimental process.
