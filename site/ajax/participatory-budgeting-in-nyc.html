		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The New York City participatory budgeting process has three main goals - inclusion,  equality, and empowerment. As their website states, "We also hope that PB will have  other benefits for the community: inspiring greater civic participation, building  community, educating and empowering residents, increasing transparency in government,  and leading to better budget decisions - spending that is more responsible and efficient,  and that results in more sustainable and livable neighborhoods. <br/> As of March 30, 2014, New York City residents have allocated funds for 70 projects,  ranging from technology upgrades to security cameras, a mobile cooking classroom,  and playground improvements.
