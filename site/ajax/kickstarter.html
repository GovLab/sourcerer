		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Kickstarter is a platform to fund creative projects. Individuals and teams that need help with funding, post their projects in the Kickstarter platform. Each project must contain  the explanation of the story behind the project, it must specify a funding goal and a  deadline to achieve it. If the project does not reach the funding goal in the determined  time lapse, it does not receive any of the money pledged by the participants. Individuals  retain the intellectual property of their projects and Kickstarter charges a 5% fee of  the raised funds of any successful project. To encourage individuals to pledge money, each  project must offer rewards according to the amount of pledged money. Besides helping projects  obtain the funding they need, Kickstarter helps develop community engagement between the project and the funders.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The idea of Kickstarter came to Perry Chen in 2002 when he tried to produce a DJ  show in New Orleans. He had found a perfect location and tried to raise the  necessary money to stage it but in the end the show did not happen since the  amount of money required was too much. Chen was disturbed by the fact that the  audience had no decision in the process. He had the idea of developing a site  where people could buy tickets in advance or pledge money for projects they were  interested in seeing coming to live, if not enough money was raised then people  would not be charged. From New Orleans Chen moved to New York where he met Yancey  Strickler, co-founder of Kickstarter. With Strickler they brainstormed ideas for  the project, then they met Charles Adler, the first designer of the platform,  who helped develop the image of the site. In April 28, 2009 they launched the  site. The first project posted was of Chen, to pledge money for stenciled t-shirts.  In 2011, they reached one million backers and in February 2012, one of the projects  in Kickstarter reached the amount of a million dollars in pledges.
