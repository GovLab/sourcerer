		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">OpenIDEO is an online platform for open innovation that enables people everywhere to use IDEO's human-centered design methodology to address pressing social and  environmental issues. Through sponsored challenges, OpenIDEO enlists a diverse  global community in a structured, collaborative process to generate and develop  innovative solutions to the world’s toughest problems. Since 2010, OpenIDEO has  run 30 online challenges that have engaged over 80,000 people from more than 170  countries in designing solutions to issues like youth employment, renewable energy,  and women’s safety in urban slums. <br/> OpenIDEO challenges typically last three months. The process starts with a  Research phase, which is an opportunity for the community to share stories,  insights and success stories in order to build empathy and more deeply understand  the challenge topic before diving into ideas submission. Based on insights gathered in the Research phase, the challenge moves into the Ideas phase, where the OpenIDEO  community shares ideas representing new approaches and solutions to the issue, and  participants work together to build and improve these ideas. At the end of the Ideas  phase, a shortlist of 20-25 ideas that have shown the most potential for impact is  selected to move to the Refinement phase, where participants focus on prototyping  and testing ideas with end users, getting feedback, and refining their ideas.  Ultimately, approximately five Top Ideas from the Challenge are announced and  featured on the platform. These ideas may be taken forward by anyone in the OpenIDEO  community, or may receive various types of implementation support from OpenIDEO and  the challenge sponsor.
