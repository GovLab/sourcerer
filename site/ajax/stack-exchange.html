		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Stack Exchange is an information exchange platform founded by Jeff Atwood and  Joel Spolsky. Users can ask questions on a given topic, and receive crowd-vetted  answers. <br/>  Stack Exchange is a network of expert Q&A communities, each categorized by a  specific professionalized field. As of July 2014, there are 125 Q&A sites within  the Stack Exchange Network, with subjects as varied as programming to cooking.  On each discrete topic site, any user can ask a question, to which the community  submits answers. The community ranks the answers that are the best fit for the  question, so the answer with the most votes becomes the most visible, and the  least applicable answer is voted down. The questions and answers can also be  amended by the community, wiki-style. <br/> The Stack Exchange community is self-governed. Governance is based on site  reputation. Reputation is earned by other community members voting on that users  previous activity. A user gains more rights as their reputation builds. Rights  include deleting, editing, and running for moderator, an elected individual who  has increased access to managing a Q&A site.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Stack Exchange evolved from Stack Overflow, a Q&A platform designed for the  software programming community that was launched on September 15, 2008 by  Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Output</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">As of July 2014 the Q&A sites support over 3.5 million users, 8 million  questions, and 15 million answers. According to co-founder Joel Spolsky,  90-95% of questions asked on the site have answers labeled as reputable. <br/> In addition, there are 574 unpublished sites - labeled “Area 51” sites -  that have been proposed by a member of the community but have not yet proven  their ability to amass experts willing to be active. <br/> The process to become a Stack Exchange site is extensive. If an individual  or community is interested in launching a new topic for a Q&A site, they  first need to provide examples of questions that would likely be proposed on  that site to indicate a defined community. The topic also needs to have a  community of experts committed to participating in the information exchange,  which is done through signing a petition. Community managers at Stack Exchange  gauge the likelihood of activity for the Area 51 site by the individuals who  sign the petition. If there are a number of individuals who show a history  of activity on Stack Exchange, the site will be approved. However, the site  initially be open only to those individuals who signed the petition to populate  the platform with enough useful questions and answers so there is already  information available when the site is open to the public.
