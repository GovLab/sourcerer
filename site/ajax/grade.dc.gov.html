		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Grade.DC.Gov is a website dedicated to opening the dialogue between the  Washington D.C. municipal government and its citizens. It enables constituents  to submit comments about certain District of Columbia agencies and view how  District residents graded those agencies.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Historical Information</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Grade D.C. formally launched in June 2012. The District of Columbia paid  $170,000 to a private technology firm, newBrandAnalytics, to build a rating  system customized for the city and $250,000 as an annual use fee.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Challenges</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Like any public and open-sourced system, Grade D.C. has limitations based  on who responds and why, with the tendency for dissatisfied residents to  respond disproportionately. Given the reliance on social media, officials  need to continuously reach out to groups such as the elderly who may not be  as engaged.
