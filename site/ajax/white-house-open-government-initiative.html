On December  8, 2009, President Barack Obama issued an Open Government (OpenGov) Directive  requiring all federal agencies to take immediate, specific steps to achieve  key milestones in transparency, participation, and collaboration throughout  his administration.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">On December 8, 2009 President Obama, in a memorandum to the Director of the  Office of Management & Budget, issued a directive for agency heads and  departments to implement principles of transparency, participation, and  collaboration with the public. The memorandum put forth 3 requirements that  agencies had to abide by: publish government information online, improve  quality of government information, create and institutionalize a culture of  open government, and create an enabling policy framework for open government.  Within these guidelines he included deadlines, and a framework for which each  agency must adopt an open government plan.
