		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">TopCoder is a digital open innovation platform that provides companies and  enterprises with access to global talent instantly to develop innovative software  applications within a distributive innovation system. <br/> TopCoder is the world’s largest platform for digital open innovation. It provides  a community of hundreds of thousands of software developers, algorithmists and  digital designers a way to accelerate the development of new products and services  by launching a specialized competition – through a prized-based business model – where  companies and enterprises get highly trained experts working in their projects. <br/> The solutions created by the TopCoder community of experts are delivered through  highly scalable processes overseen by TopCoder and clients themselves provide  guidance and feedback through the entire process of software development from  concept, designs and build to delivery, enhancement and maintenance of digital  offerings in support of their different products and services. <br/> According to Professor Karim Lakhani, the incentives for the expert community  to participate in TopCoder are heterogeneous ranging from the monetary incentive,  having a sense of community, the learning from the process and just for the fun  of it. Having people participating with different motivations is important for  the resilience of the platform.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">TopCoder has a broad catalog of software development completed through  crowdsourcing – from mobile apps to entire enterprise systems – with their  global community of experts completing the entire project in a relatively  short period of time. <br/> Harvard Medical School used TopCoder to host a 2 week competition to improve  the processing speed of a big data biomedics program. With $6,000 in total  prize money, 733 registrants and 122 members submitting working algorithms,  TopCoder provided HMS with a winning solution that performed hundreds of times  faster and at a higher degree of accuracy than the best-known existing solution,  reducing the time to execution from 2000 seconds to just over 16 seconds.
