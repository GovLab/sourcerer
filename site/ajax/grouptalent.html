		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Headquartered in San Francisco, GroupTalent is a hiring platform that lists  contract-for-hire opportunities so a developer can try out working with a  company before they commit to a longer-term job. <br/> If you are an employer seeking a programmer, a company pays GroupTalent to  list the job opportunity on the platform. Using an algorithm, GroupTalent  then matches the listing description with actively-looking programmers who  are registered on GroupTalent after being vetted by the platform’s staff.  The employer can then invite a programmer for an interview for a  contract-to-hire opportunity. At the end of the predefined period of time,  the employer can extend an offer for longer-term employment. <br/> Now based in San Francisco, GroupTalent was developed out of TechStars  Seattle and raised $1 million in funding from Version One Ventures, Menlo  Ventures, and Founder’s Co-op.
