		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">SeeClickFix is a multifaceted citizen reporting engine featuring user-generated  information in a wide variety of areas. The site’s Web 2.0-like interface provides  a wealth of information on a given issue, and allows for users to interact with  existing problems on the site, potentially amplifying their importance for  governments. <br/> SeeClickFix is a growing platform that allows citizens to publicly report a wide  variety of civic issues and then monitor their development. The most active cities  on the platform are Chicago, Illinois; Washington, DC; Malden, Massachusetts; Macon,  Georgia and Winston-Salem, North Carolina. <br/>  The SeeClickFix website prompts users to enter their neighborhood into a form,  which leads them to a site featuring a searchable collection of user-generated  issues that allow for citizen comments, featuring an issue “up-voting” system.  The collection of issues can be viewed in list form, on a map or as a gallery of  uploaded images. Each individual issue entry can feature user-supplied images,  the ability to view the issue on a map, information on when it was reported and  by whom, a list of notified stakeholders, the ability for users to follow the  issue and links to other nearby problems reported on the site. Each neighborhood  also features an “Answers” user forum, a list of “Neighbors” using the site and a  collection of mapped “Watch Areas” for user monitoring. <br/> SeeClickFix also offers mobile apps for IOS, Android, Windows Phone and Blackberry that allow citizens to report issues, browse open problems, view a list of active neighbors and send and receive messages. The company also provides links on its  website for governments to request custom mobile apps for their area.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Historical Information</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">SeeClickFix was launched in September 2008 as a communications  platforms for citizens in New Haven that wanted to report non-emergency issues.  Ben Berkowitz on of the cofounders of SeeClickFix had the idea to create the  platform after trying to get some graffiti of the wall of his neighbour’s building.  After talking with him and realizing he was not going to offer much help,  Berkowitz decided to call the city hall to have the problem fixed. Various of  his calls went unanswered and out of his frustration the idea of creating a platform  to report non-emergency issues came to his mind. If citizens could upload photos  of city problems that needed to get fixed, then the government could be held  accountable. Some of his cofounders had similar frustrations regarding the delivery  of social service and decided to create the platform. The platform is open so any  individual can post problems in their own communities. They also have partnered  with multiple local governments to create personalized versions of the app and have  created a platform so media partners can engage with their community through the website.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">SeeClickFix’s sophisticated and well-designed web and mobile interface make  it very easy for citizens to report and monitor problems. The ability to  up-vote issues gives users an avenue for reiterating the need to address a  problem, and helps demonstrate to government which issues are currently  the most important to constituents.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Challenges</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">A lack of advanced browsing and search filters for a given neighborhood could  make it difficult for users to find information on a given issue, particularly  if they are not aware of the exact geographic location of the issue. While the  option exists for users to simply create a second entry on the issue, spreading  the comments and up-votes on the issue across two or more entries could dilute  influence.
