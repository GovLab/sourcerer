		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">RosPil is a crowdsourcing project designed to investigate possible cases of  corruption in public procurement. Five lawyers and a supervisor run the project.  RosPil relies on the crowdsourced leads that people send them of suspicions that  a tender public process might be corrupt. The lawyers of RosPil analyze the data  they receive to verify if it can become a potential case to be presented before  the Prosecutor. RosPil also relies on a network of experts to whom they crowdsource  the diverse case in order to obtain from them the necessary technical knowledge  to know if a particular procurement process is drafted in suspicious ways.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Alexey Navalny is a Russian lawyer, stock trader and political activist. He  founded RosPil in 2010 to continue in a more organized manner the personal  enterprise he has been doing since 2007 of exposing cases of corruption in big  state-owned enterprises. Navalny began doing this in sight of his own financial  interests since he became owner of a considerable amount of stocks from three  big state-owned companies: Rosneft, Gazprom, and Transneft. After receiving  small returns on the investments he had made, he started taking a more active  role by investigating the management of these companies. He stumbled one day  with a news article about a big donation carried out by Transneft to a number  of charitable organizations. After unsuccessfully trying to find out which  institutions received the donation, he asked the most important charitable institutions if they had received part of the aforementioned money. Since none of them  had received any money from Transneft he decided to file a criminal investigation  to find out the destination of the money that was supposedly donated. The case  made little progress over four years and was finally dropped. After finding out  more cases of corruption in the managerial aspects of state-owned companies,  Navalny opened a blog in 2007 to expose these cases. This blog received  considerable interest from the public. After starting to receive leads from more  possible cases of corruption from individuals who read his blog he decided to  open RosPil in 2010.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Description of the participants</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">RosPil works with three different types of crowd. The first is composed of  individuals who revise the different tender processes that are posted on the site of the Federal Antimonopoly Service of the Russian Federation. These  individuals are Internet users that have the necessary technical knowledge  to understand the usual slang of terms of reference drafts. The second crowd  from which RosPil leverages their intelligence is composed of a series of  experts of diverse fields that could understand what is being asked from a  particular procurement process. These individuals can provide the necessary  feedback to the organization in terms of how plausible it is to acquire the  given services or products under that particular contract. The third crowd  is composed of individuals that give money to the organization through their  website or mobile application.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Lessons Learned</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">One of RosPilâ€™s good practices is the triple process of crowdsourcing they practice to run their project.  1) They rely on a crowd to inform them of suspicious tender processes.  2) After making a preliminary analysis of the terms of draft of the procurement process, they ask a  crowd of specialists about the particular technical requirements of that procurement process  in order to corroborate if it is plausible to have a bid under the conditions stated in the contract.  3) They obtain their financial resources by crowdfunding.
