		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">99designs is an online platform that connects graphic designers  with potential clients by hosting design challenges. <br/> The company creates their products by crowdsourcing, as customers can  solicit designers to submit designs for contests to create products  such as websites, t-shirts, or logos. The customer then chooses the best  design from the pool of submitted entries and the selected designer will  win a cash payment. Customers also have the option of working with individual  designers by purchasing design templates from 99designs’ Readymade logo store  or by visiting Swiftly for quick graphic design fixes and steal logo's.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">"Back in 2008, 99designs’ Founder Mark Harbottle locked colleagues Lachlan  Donald and Paul Annesley in an office in Melbourne to pioneer a new kind  of marketplace for graphic design. <br/> Mark and Matt Mickiewicz, already co-founders of successful online media  and publishing company SitePoint, along with Internet pioneer and entrepreneur  Leni Mayo and Melbourne IT Non-Executive Director and ex-CEO of Hitwise,  Andrew Walsh, became founding investors in the startup. <br/> Upon launch, 99designs quickly caught the eye of small business owners around  the world looking for a fast, affordable alternative to the traditional  design process. The service was off to a flying start. <br/> By 2010, the business had opened offices in San Francisco and won the  prestigious Webby People's Voice Award for Best Web Service and  Application. <br/> In April 2011, 99designs announced a $35 million Series A investment  to assist with its global expansion. This investment round was led by  Accel Partners, with participation from angel investors Michael Dearing  (eBay, Harrision Metal), Dave Goldberg (Survey Monkey), Stewart Butterfield (Flickr, Tiny Speck) and Anthony Casalena (Squarespace). <br/> In August 2012, 99designs made its first acquisition, purchasing European  creative services marketplace 12designer to help fuel its global growth.  Following the acquisition and establishment of its European headquarters  in Berlin, 99designs launched localized versions of its services in German,  French, Spanish, Dutch and Italian. <br/> This global expansion continued with the acquisition of LogoChef - one  of Brazil's leading design marketplaces - in August 2013. <br/> That same month, 99designs introduced an entirely different way for  businesses to get small design tasks done quickly: Swiftly. The  first-of-its-kind service is part of 99designs' broader plan to change  the paradigm for how businesses worldwide get graphic design work done  and how designers earn money."
