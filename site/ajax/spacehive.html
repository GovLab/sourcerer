		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Spacehive is the first Civic Crowdfunding platform, allowing communities to raise  money for specific public use neighborhood projects. Created in December 2011,  Spacehive has provided a platform for over 230 civic initiatives in the United  Kingdom. <br/>  Spacehive is a United Kingdom-based civic crowdfunding platform that allows  citizens to contribute to neighborhood improvement projects. A first of its kind,  the Spacehive platform allows anyone to pitch an idea and request community support.  In return, community members can pledge funding. If the project funding target is  reached, the project gets the green light. <br/> The critical component of a project on Spacehive is that the proposal is for a  public space, i.e. the community can access freely. Online proposals must include  a description of the project, an explanation of how the money will be used to meet  project goals, and a pitch on why the project is needed. Examples include Christmas  decorations on a town bridge that were previously cut for austerity measures,  launching a free WiFi zone at a local mall, and a campaign to save a community theater  company. <br/> There are no fees to post and donate to the project. However, Spacehive charges an  administrative fee if a project fits its fundraising goal. According to the  Spacehive website, these administrative fees total 3.7% on the first 500,000  pounds raised, 2.5% on the next 500,000 pounds, and 1.5% thereafter. Current project  goals range from 90 pounds to more than 600,000 pounds.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Launched in February 2012, Spacehive was founded by former Sunday Times  journalist Chris Gourlay in response to a perceived dearth of investment and  creativity in public spaces.
