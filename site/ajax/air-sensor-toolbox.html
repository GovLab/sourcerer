		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Developed in 2014, the Air Sensor Toolbox gives information about emerging technologies,  in particular those associated with low-cost sensors. It also outlines sampling methodologies,  gives a set of data interpretation guidelines and offers education and outreach materials. <br/> The toolbox begins with an Air Sensor Guidebook. Air quality sensors costing as little as $100  are now commercially available in a wide variety of designs and with various capabilities.  Using the guidebook, citizens can learn how to select and use sensors to investigate common air pollutants. <br/> The toolbox also contains a description of a prototype monitoring system for measuring nitrogen  dioxide and particulate matter in the air. The Citizen Science Air Monitor was recently developed  for a citizen science pilot project. The system’s operating procedures explain how to use the device  to collect meaningful air quality information. <br/> In addition, the toolbox describes research that EPA is leading on the development of mobile sensors  and applications for detecting air pollutants. The goal is to help strengthen local community-based  air monitoring projects. The toolbox also contains a systematic evaluation of low-cost sensors for ozone,  nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter and volatile organic compounds, along with a comprehensive set of  guidelines that citizen scientists can use to ensure that their data are sound.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The town of Tonawanda, New York, has some of the state’s largest industrial facilities, and in 2004 local  citizens noticed something wrong with the air. Concerned about smells and smoke, they suspected a connection  between air quality and chronic health problems in their community. <br/> Organized as the Clean Air Coalition of Western New York, volunteers used simple devices to collect air samples  and find out what was in the air. Sure enough, they found high levels of benzene, a known carcinogen. <br/> Based on the results, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation worked with the Environmental  Protection Agency to do further air quality testing. Ultimately, the Tonawanda Coke Corporation agreed to improve  operations, monitor for leaks and upgrade pollution controls, decreasing benzene levels in the air by 86 percent. <br/> Recognizing that citizens want to learn more about local air quality, EPA scientists are collaborating with  technology developers and with federal, state, international and nongovernmental organizations on the potential  use of emerging technologies to meet a wide range of air quality monitoring needs. The agency now has a website,  the Air Sensor Toolbox for Citizen Science, with information and guidance on new low-cost portable technologies  for measuring air quality.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Data used for regulatory purposes must meet tough standards, and some have raised concerns about the  quality of the data generated by citizen science projects. The toolbox has information on data quality  issues that citizens need to be familiar with as they plan their projects. Although EPA does not use volunteer  data directly, many states use data collected by volunteers in their own assessments.
