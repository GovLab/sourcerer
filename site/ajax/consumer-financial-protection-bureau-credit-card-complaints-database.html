		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">A key mission of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)  is to make the financial products and services available to citizens  more transparent. The Consumer Complaint Database – created by the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the first U.S. 21st-century  consumer agency, allows consumers (and anonymous whistleblowers) to  directly submit, view, download and visualize complaints.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Historical Information</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The Consumer Complaint Database launched on June 2013, following the  formation of the CFPB in July 2011, which continues to oversee site  management. The CFPB was founded as a result of the Dodd–Frank Wall  Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which passed in response  to the Late-2000s recession and financial crisis. The bureau began  operation on July 21, 2011. Congress established the CFPB to protect  consumers by carrying out federal consumer financial laws. The CFPB  seeks to ensure that consumers get the information they need to make  the financial decisions they believe are best for themselves and their  families, that prices are clear up front, that risks are visible and  that nothing is buried in fine print. The agency has the power to write  rules, supervise companies, and enforce federal consumer financial  protection laws; restrict unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices;  take consumer complaints; promote financial education; research consumer  behavior; monitor financial markets for new risks to consumers; and  enforce laws that outlaw discrimination and other unfair treatment in  consumer finance.
