		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">"Radiation-watch.org is an open and non-profit project to develop cheap and smart  radiation detector. The project is supported by volunteer scientists, engineers  and designers." The goal of the non-profit project to develop cheap and smart  radiation detector for everyone, especially around and in Fukushima. <br/> The Smart Radiation Detector plugs into the audio jack of an iPhone and uses a  radiation-detecting diode instead of a Geiger-Muller tube, which is still  sensitive enough to detect trace amounts of radiation, that can then be neatly  visualized with an accompanying iOS app. The Smart Radiation Detector sells  for US $50.
