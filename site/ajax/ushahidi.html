		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Ushahidi is a free, open source interactive mapping platform that can draw in a wide variety of data streams to visually present location-based information. It was originally developed in response to post-election violence in Kenya in  2008 and has since been used for a wide variety of humanitarian and civic ends.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Ushahidi, which means “testimony” in Swahili, was originally developed by an  ad hoc group of volunteers in January 2008 to help map reports of violence following  the Kenyan election. It all originated with a blogpost request by Ory Okolloh, a  famous blogger and lawyer from Kenya, who had to leave the country as a result of the  violence acts that broke from the 2007 election. Okolloh asked if there were a group  of techies willing to develop a platform to report violence and destruction acts in  real time using Google Maps, since she believed that government and media were  underreporting the number of deaths that were taking place. After the blog was posted a two day mashup took place and from there Ushahidi resulted. Since the platform had  more than 45,000 registered users the founders of Ushahidi decided to develop a platform  that could be used by anyone around the world to report and map real time situations.  The Ushahidi platform has been used for citizen reporting in various natural disaster  situations and in political conflicts, like in the earthquakes of Haiti and Chile.  Six year after its creation, Ushahidi founded iHub, an innovation hub for the technology  community in Nairobi. They also helped implement the Making all Voices Count Challenge,  a fund that helps to scale up projects that seek to engage citizen participation towards  effective governance and accountability in Asia and Africa.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The Ushahidi website provides a wealth of information for developers, but little guidance for people seeking to contribute to a particular deployment.  While the Community section features a map and list of deployments, a more central means of discovery for users could prove beneficial.
