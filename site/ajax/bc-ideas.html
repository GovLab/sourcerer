		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">BC Ideas is an innovation community and problem-solving marketplace that grew  out of the prize-based contest Solutions for Strong Communities. The original  contest accepted a wide range of submissions in a number of topic areas and  provided a total of $270,000 in grants.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">While the BC Ideas community continues to thrive—115 innovations are  currently posted in the “Marketplace,” seeking to gain collaborators  and funding—the actual contests have concluded, and there is no mention of a  second iteration being in the works. <br/>  By accepting submissions at every stage, including the idea stage, the  Solutions for Stronger Communities competition lowered the barrier for engagement for those with potential solutions who lacked the capital or expertise to put  their solutions into action. However, this low barrier to entry could also delay  the impact of contest winners, since entries could take a significant amount of  time and capital to operationalize.
