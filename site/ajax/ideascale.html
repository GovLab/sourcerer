		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Ideascale is an innovation management / brainstorming platform that helps  clients collect feedback and ideas with an easy-to-use online interface. <br/> The system enables users to create "campaigns" to solicit ideas from users  on a given topic and allows individual users to vote up and down on ideas  and comment. The system prioritizes ideas based on popularity, allowing an  organization to winnow out the good from the bad and the popular from the  less-interesting.
