		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Foldit is a online-based puzzle game, where participants engage in simulated  protein folding in order to predict protein structure. <br/> Predicting the lowest energy state of a protein is a task computers are poor at,  but people are good at. Foldit is an attempt to gamify the process of predicting  protein structures to crowdsource the data-gathering. <br/> Foldit is the creation of biochemist, David Baker, and game designer, Zoran  Popovic, both of whom work at the University of Washington in Seattle. The game  is downloaded onto a player’s personal computer and then allow the player to  manipulate protein structures. <br/> There are a series of levels a player moves through, with the earliest levels  acting as training rounds, where players work on already-known proteins in  order to learn the basics of protein folding skills. The game involves a  point-system, where the highest number of points are awarded to those with proteins that have been manipulated to have the lowest-energy configurations. <br/> As described in an article by the Scientific American website, “The Foldit  exploration puzzle game attempts to predict the structure of a protein by  taking advantage of our puzzle-solving intuitions and having people play  competitively to fold the best proteins. Players can also design brand new  proteins that could help prevent or treat important diseases.”

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">David Baker, a biochemist at the University of Washington, designed Foldit  with the help of Zoran Popovic, a computer scientist also at the University  of Washington, and David Salesin. The idea to develop Foldit came from the  Rosetta@Home program, a distributed computing project designed to predict  the structure of proteins. Rosetta@Home works with the help of millions of  computers that have the program installed and that help process the information  of the structure of particular proteins. This information is displayed in the  form of a screensaver to each individual computer. David Baker realized  that users could not only help by downloading the program but also by helping  the program design the structure of the proteins. The three of them decided  that the best way to incentivize people to participate in figuring out the  structure of proteins was developing a game, where proteins could be folded  in different ways minimizing the space between each piece, just like in Tetris. In May, 2008 the beta version of the video game was released to the public.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">As of January 2012, Foldit had 240,000 registered users, and the Foldit  application was available for PC, Mac, and Linux.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Impact</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Foldit has the potential to help advance cures for serious diseases such  as AIDS. According to a September 2011 Time Magazine blogpost, “Gamers  playing a protein-folding game called Foldit have helped unlock the structure  of an AIDS-related enzyme that the scientific community had been unable  to unlock for a decade.”
