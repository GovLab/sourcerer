		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">DriveBC is the central hub of vehicle related information, services and  citizen reporting for the province. The service provides citizens with  contact information to report highway issues, with optimized site versions  for desktop and mobile, and a strong Twitter presence.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Historical Information</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">DriveBC was overhauled in March 2012 by its operating department, the  Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. None of the most recent  updates, however, have affected the citizen reporting aspect of the site.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Challenges</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Drive BC’s citizen reporting functionality does not feature any on-site  means of citizen input. For all issues, citizens are directed to contact  information, notably telephone numbers, with no option for simply typing  in a description of the issue and the address directly from the Web or  mobile. While this capability exists using the DriveBC Twitter account,  it is questionable whether citizens would ascertain this fact from visiting  the desktop or mobile Drivebc.ca site. <br/> Drive BC’s ability to guide citizen input regarding issues on different  types of provincial roads and highways, as well as wildfires, chemical  spills and downed power lines could go unnoticed by citizens because the  link to report such issues is subtly presented on the site. Moreover,  the link citizens need to click, on mobile or desktop, is confusingly  labeled “Report a Highway Problem.” Based on this subtlety and misleading  label, citizens attempting to report a wildfire or a pothole on a municipal  road could easily assume that Drive BC is not the correct place to make  such a report.
