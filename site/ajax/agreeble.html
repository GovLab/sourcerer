		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Historical Information</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Agreeble started to answer the question, which opinions drive consensus between people on polar ends of an issue? <br/> We proved the concept by playing an index card version of the game, which worked great for about five people. Once we worked out kinks in the model, development began, and we started working with larger sample sets.  <br/> We incorporated in January of 2014 and have since added advisors in research, ux,  marketing, and rhetoric. We have additionally partnered with Amazon and uSamp for sourcing samples.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Impact</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">We believe that part of the problem with polarization is the platform. Our goal  is to shed light on the grey, when issues seem black or white, and see if we  can't unlock consensus in the process.
