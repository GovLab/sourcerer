		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">FixMyStreet is a U.K.-based service allowing citizens to report problems in their  area, view them on a map, discuss them with fellow citizens, monitor their  development and provide or read citizen updates. The service automatically sends  the citizen reports to the relevant government council upon receipt.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Challenges</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">FixMyStreet features little in the way of community functions, outside  of the ability to provide updates on otherâ€™s reported issues. The site  also lacks any ability to browse or search for issues based on any criteria  other than location and relevant government council.
