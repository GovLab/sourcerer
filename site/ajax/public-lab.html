		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The Public Lab for Open Technology and Science (Public Lab) is an organization  that is focused on “civic science” through shared methods, hardware, and software  for use in experiments in different communities.  <br/> Public lab is an online community where members participate in “civic science”  experiments through the creation of different scientific tools, as well as the  reporting back of the scientific data collected using those tools. The tools  include both hardware and software. The Public Lab organization also provides  support for community members through the website. <br/> There are various Public Lab projects being conducted at any given time. Current  tools include: indoor air quality mapping, balloon and kite mapping, home testing  for endocrine disruptors, balloon telemetry, and spectrometry. <br/> Public Lab has used Kickstarter extensively to fund the organization as well as  specific projects. If donors contribute a specific amount to one of Public Lab’s  Kickstarter campaigns, they receive a kit providing them with all the materials  to build a specific piece of equipment to participate in the project. The kits are  designed to include materials that are readily available and easy to assemble, so  that participants who do not wish to contribute and receive the kit can still  build the tools to participate in the project. Additionally, Public Lab is a 501c3  non-profit, meaning that it can receive tax-deductible donations.
