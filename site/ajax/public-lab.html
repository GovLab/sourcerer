		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The Public Lab for Open Technology and Science (Public Lab) is an organization  that is focused on “civic science” through shared methods, hardware, and software  for use in experiments in different communities.  <br/> Public lab is an online community where members participate in “civic science”  experiments through the creation of different scientific tools, as well as the  reporting back of the scientific data collected using those tools. The tools  include both hardware and software. The Public Lab organization also provides  support for community members through the website. <br/> There are various Public Lab projects being conducted at any given time. Current  tools include: indoor air quality mapping, balloon and kite mapping, home testing  for endocrine disruptors, balloon telemetry, and spectrometry. <br/> Public Lab has used Kickstarter extensively to fund the organization as well as  specific projects. If donors contribute a specific amount to one of Public Lab’s  Kickstarter campaigns, they receive a kit providing them with all the materials  to build a specific piece of equipment to participate in the project. The kits are  designed to include materials that are readily available and easy to assemble, so  that participants who do not wish to contribute and receive the kit can still  build the tools to participate in the project. Additionally, Public Lab is a 501c3  non-profit, meaning that it can receive tax-deductible donations.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Public Lab was inspired by the information blackout surrounding the 2010 BP Oil Disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Despite having a massive impact on  residents and the environment, local communities received sparse, incomplete  data that contradicted what they could see unfolding in front of them. As  news of the spill’s severity spread and outrage about limited access to  information simmered locally, three of Public Lab’s would-be co-founders,  Shannon Dosemagen, Jeff Warren and Stewart Long, convened in the Gulf Coast  with a plan to use helium balloons, kites and inexpensive digital cameras to  loft their own "community satellites" over the spill. The trio, in partnership  with New Orleans-based environmental justice organization, Louisiana Bucket Brigade,  trained over one hundred local volunteers and activists who then collected over  100,000 aerial images of the coastline before, during, and after the oil spread.  Using MapKnitter, an open source platform created by the group, residents stitched  these images into high-resolution maps of the disaster. Through a partnership  with Google Earth Outreach, these community-created maps were then uploaded to  Google Earth making them globally accessible. The maps of the spill received broad  media coverage, including being featured by the New York Times, BBC, PBS, and the  Boston Globe, allowing residents to speak their truth to the world about what was  going on in the Gulf Coast. The success of the grassroots mapping effort galvanized  Dosemagen, Warren, and Long, along with other collaborators, to found Public Lab as  a new research and social space for the development of cheap tools for community  based environmental monitoring and research. With early support from the John S.  and James L. Knight Foundation via the Knight New Challenge, the group formally  launched Public Lab as a nonprofit organization in summer 2011.
