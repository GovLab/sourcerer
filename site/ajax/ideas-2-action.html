		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Ideas2Action was a crowdsourced effort undertaken by the Premier of British  Columbia, Canada, Christy Clark, to help generate new ideas for building a  skilled workforce in BC. Premier Christy Clark held a seven-week online  consultation period to obtain ideas from the public. More than 52,000 visitors  went to the BC Jobs Plan website, and approximately 500 British Columbians  contributed to the discussion.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The Skills for BC consultation was held from November to December 2012 and led  by Premier Christy Clark. Citizen input was then reviewed and acted upon by the  BC Jobs Plan Team, relevant government officials and partners like the Industry  Training Authority.  <br/> The #Skills4BC public consultation occurred over a seven-week period, in which  each week’s discussion revolved around a different question.
 Week 1 – How can British Columbia’s young people build a successful trades or technical career and be first in line for BC jobs?
 Week 2 – What can we, as parents and schools, do to change people’s notions of trades and technical careers?
 Week 3 – What advice would you give on exploring alternatives to traditional routes to a trades career?
 Week 4 – How can BC communities and businesses get ready to seize the opportunities coming with liquefied natural gas (LNG)?
 Week 5 – How can employers deal with the upcoming skills shortage? The Ideas2Action website now lists 
 citizen ideas and government actions in topics like: Increase Trades Awareness, Improve Apprenticeship 
 System, Increase Numbers in Trades, Worker Support, Coordination and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG).

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Challenges</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Using the title Skills for BC for the discussion portion of the project and  Ideas2Action for post-consultation government response, all under the wider  umbrella of the BC Jobs Plan, could create confusion. Using the same title for  each stage of the initiative would make it easier for citizens to understand the  nature of the consultation and to continue their interest and involvement as  government continues to act on public suggestions. <br/> While the consultation period is over, and contact information is available on  the site, the continued presence of an ideas-based discussion forum could be valuable,  even if relevant government agencies are unable to review or act on any new  suggestions for the foreseeable future. Providing an outlet for citizen discussion  in this area could prove worthwhile on its own terms.
