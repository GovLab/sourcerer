		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">"The Smithsonian Institution has 138 million objects and specimens as well as 2 million library volumes. Altogether, the Smithsonian has  over 157,000 cubic feet of archival material in its various collections. Less than 1 percent are on display in its 19 museums, libraries,  galleries, archives and research centers. What might we learn if we could search the thoughts of artists, scientists, inventors, explorers  and revolutionaries as expressed in the documents and specimens of the Smithsonian’s collections? Now, through digitization and transcription,  ordinary citizens can help bring their insights to light! <br/> Participants in the project volunteer to type what they see in logbooks and on pages and specimen labels using instructions tailored to each  document type. Volunteers can contribute anonymously or create an account to track their work. Once volunteers have an account, they may review  the work of others and make edits where necessary. <br/> Each week, new projects are added, with new discoveries waiting in the pages! TheSmithsonian Transcription Center uses social media, email and blog  posts to connect volunteers to each other and provide details about collections featured in the center. <br/> The text that volunteers create goes into the Smithsonian’s database, searchable in the Collections Search Center. As volunteers transcribe  specimen labels, they create data to make new collection records. As they work, volunteers are creating greater access to and more useful  information for Smithsonian Institution collections — which is seriously amazing!"

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Challenges</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">"For crowdsourcing projects like the Smithsonian Transcription Center, upholding the quality and validity of transcribed  data is important. Volunteers work with Smithsonian staff in a three-step peer review process: Anyone can transcribe;  registered volunteers review; and then staff validate the submissions. Specialized instructions for each type of material  help keep volunteers on track, and they can submit questions directly or through social media. <br/> Sustaining volunteer engagement is another challenge; the Smithsonian Transcription Center shares the collective success  of volunteers as frequently as possible. Volunteers also have special behind-the-scenes access to curators and collections  managers, and they get first peeks at newly digitized collections. They also have the opportunity to share what they are  learning as they transcribe."
