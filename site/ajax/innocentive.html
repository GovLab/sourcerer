		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The original idea for this crowdsourcing project came from Alph Bingham and  Aaron Schacht, coworkers in the pharmaceutical Eli Lilly and Company. Coming  from the pharmaceutical industry, Bingham and Schacht had a first hand perspective  on the challenge that R&D budgets represent to companies. In the pharmaceutical  industry one of their perennial efforts is to improve the cycle time for drug  discovery and development. This effort comes with the challenge of reducing the  enormous costs that failures in the R&D departments of the pharmaceutical industry  represent in monetary terms.  <br/> Having in mind the particular problems that the pharmaceutical industry faces in creating value from their expensive R&D, Bingham and Schach created a prototype of the platform in 1998 after collaboratively thinking of ways in which to incorporate  Internet into business strategies. In 2001 InnoCentive was launched by Jill Panetta,  Jeff Hensley, Darren Carroll, and Alph Bingham. One of the motives behind the creation  of this platform for communal work was to enable what the Internet provides: a global  marketplace of qualified individuals that can produce faster and cheaper innovation.
