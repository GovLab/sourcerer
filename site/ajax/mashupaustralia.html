		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The Australian Government 2.0 Taskforce created Mashup Australia to offer a  practical demonstration of the benefits that open access to Australian public  sector information (PSI) can provide. By working to establish this contest,  the government also provided a practical demonstration of what open access is  and does, while identifying some of the barriers that exist within government  to a broader adoption of open access to PSI.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Historical Information</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">In 2009, from October – November, the Australian government released 59  government datasets from 23 local and national agencies for a “hackathon.” <br/> The Government 2.0 Taskforce was established by the Australian Government  in 2009 as a joint initiative between the Hon. Lindsay Tanner MP, Minister  for Finance and Deregulation and Senator the Hon. Joe Ludwig, Cabinet  Secretary and Special Minister of State. <br/> The purpose of the Taskforce is to investigate how the Australian Government  can increase the openness of government and encourage greater online  engagement.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Output</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The primary objective of MashupAustralia was to showcase how something as  simple as, for example, the locations of government services or census data,  can deliver benefits to the research, commercial and community sectors—and  to citizens at large. <br/> The government also hoped to address some of the challenges raised by open  access to PSI, and awarded bonuses to entrants that sought to transform,  enrich and enhance data sets into more useful and open formats in the process  of building their entries. <br/> Finally, the government also aimed to drive community engagement, an ongoing goal  of the Government 2.0 Taskforce.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Challenges</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The greatest impediment to the program is that Australia lacks a central  hub for all challenges, but instead has one-off sites and programs. This  compounds other problems, most notably those regarding resource allocation;  for example, individual agencies are not empowered to launch their own  challenges, and most challenges tend to be short-lived.
