		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Neighbor.ly is a crowdfunding site for local governments, neighborhoods,  and certain civic-natured nonprofits. <br/> Similar to civic crowdfunding site Brickstarter, Neighbor.ly aims to connect  communities with new funding sources, companies with new earned media  opportunities, and citizens with the community projects they care about. Local  governments, nonprofits, and neighborhood organizations can submit proposals  to a simple review process. Once the proposal has been approved, the funding  campaign can be launched. Neighbor.ly provides some simple tips for running a  successful campaign, and points prospective crowdfunders towards successful  campaigns for more hints.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Historical Information</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Neighbor.ly is the fundraising toolkit for community projects of Luminopolis.  The idea came to Jase Wilson from a series of fortunate circumstances: hearing a talk of Rob  Goodspeed about civic crowdsourcing, attending a public meeting to discuss the funding of a  streetcar, watching a video game break a record for funding at Kickstarter and a breakfast he had  with Patrick Hosty one of the advisors of the site. At this breakfast, Wilson  and Hosty where discussing a bond deal when a person overheard their conversation and started discussing with them. This person decided not to vote for that particular bond deal because it lumped sewer repairs with paying for other civic amenities, like buying new animals for the zoo. Hosty and this person got into a heated discussion which gave Wilson the idea for the site. The site was thought to fund civic projects one really cared about.
