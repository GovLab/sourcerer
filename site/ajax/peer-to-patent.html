		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The Peer-to-Patent project captured the importance of getting expertise and  information into government to inform policymaking. Peer To Patent is the first social-software project directly linked to decision-making by the federal government.  It is only one approach in the potential evolution toward more open and  collaborative institutions. <br/> Peer To Patent is a historic initiative by the United States Patent and Trademark  Office (USPTO) that opens the patent examination process to public participation for  the first time. Peer to Patent is an online system that aims to improve the quality of  issued patents by enabling the public to supply the USPTO with information relevant to  assessing the claims of pending patent applications. <br/> An initial pilot examined more than 220 patent applications in the fields of software  and business methods. The Peer To Patent project has issued two anniversary reports  from the initial pilot and a final report from the initial pilot is pending. <br/> Other patent offices involved in pilot programs include IP Australia,the Japan Patent  Office, and the Korean Intellectual Property Office.The UK Intellectual Property Office  announced on November 4, 2010, that it would commence a pilot in 2011 and the pilot  commenced on 1 June 2011.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">In 2005, before Facebook and Twitter, New York Law School students and the chair of the Research Network, Beth Noveck, designed and later launched Peer to Patent,  the first expert network in government, which connected volunteer scientists  and technologists to national patent offices to better inform how they decide  who gets the twenty year grant of the monopoly right called a patent. They  invented the process, technology and the policy by which a closed bureaucracy could  open its doors and collaborate with knowledgeable people to do its work better. Time  after time, the public was able to dig up quickly the expertise the official could not find, enabling him/her to make the final determination informed by citizen  participation but subject to the independent law and rules of the patent process.  Despite the fact that patent practice had not changed much since Thomas Jefferson  began as the first examiner in 1791, under the new Patent Act, passed with near  unanimity – Peer to Patent citizen engagement, once an experimental pilot undertaken  only with the applying inventor's consent – is now enshrined in law.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Output</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">As of November 24, 2010, there had been 557,560 page views from 114,395 unique viewers  in 173 countries or territories. More than 2, 800 people signed up to be reviewers. * Peer To Patent attracted more than 2,000 peer reviewers. * The first 27 office actions issued during the pilot phase showed use of Peer To  Patent submitted prior art in nine rejections. * On average, citizen-reviewers contributed 6 hours reviewing each patent application in the pilot. * Although USPTO rules permit third-party prior art submissions on pending applications (but only  before the applications have been published, or before a notice of allowance is issued, whichever  comes first), the average number of prior art submissions on Peer To Patent applications was 2,000  times that of standard rule-based submissions. * 92% of patent examiners surveyed said they would welcome examining another application with public participation, while 73% of participating examiners want to see Peer-to-Patent implemented as a regular  office practice. * 21% of participating examiners stated that prior art submitted by the Peer To Patent community was  "inaccessible" directly to USPTO examiners. * Prior art submissions by Peer-to-Patent reviewers were four times as likely to include non-patent  literature (any document that is not a patent, including Web sites, journals, textbooks, and databases)  as compared to prior art submissions by applicant

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Criticism of the Peer to Patent project range from its goals to its likelihood of success.  Other criticisms focus on the legal constraints and the implications for third party  participants in the approval process.
