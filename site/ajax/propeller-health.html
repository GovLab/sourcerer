		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Propeller Health is a mobile platform for respiratory health management  designed to help patients and their physicians better understand and control  respiratory disease to reduce preventable emergency room visits and hospitalizations. <br/> Propeller applies data to solve one of the most pressing public health concerns  – asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) – including sharing data,  putting data in the hands of patients, leveraging aggregated and anonymous data and  linking health data to place. Through sensors, mobile apps and services, Propeller  aims to reduce the cost of care while delivering better quality of life for individuals  with chronic respiratory disease. Asthma and COPD diseases are unique in that patients  carry their inhalers with them and use them at the time and place when they have symptoms.  The sensor is a small device that attaches to the top of the existing inhaler and can be used with both rescue and controller medications for tracking symptoms and adherence  respectively. The objective data it collects, and the personalized feedback patients get as a result, can help them and their physicians to better understand and manage these  conditions by tracking how often they use their medication and by setting up medication  reminders and alerts.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Historical Information</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Propeller Health was founded in 2010 by David Van Sickel, a former epidemiologist  for the Center for Disease Control & Prevention. One of the first apps with  FDA-clearance, Propeller is backed by The Social+Capital Partnership, California  HealthCare Foundation and others. Propeller Health currently works with organizations  like Dignity Health, Wyckoff Heights Medical Center, Amerigroup Florida and the City  of Louisville.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Output</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">“Early studies found a 50 percent reduction in the number of people with uncontrolled  asthma among users of the device and app. The survey app enables providers to check  in more often with their patients and may help avoid asthma-related emergency  department visits or hospitalizations.”

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-title"><span>Impact</span></div>
		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">People with asthma and COPD are strongly recommended to keep track of their symptoms,  triggers and use of medications. However, evidence shows that remembering to update  this information is tough for patients and it often becomes an inaccurate and incomplete  record of their respiratory health over time. Clinical trials report improved asthma  control and decline in day-to-day asthma symptoms associated with remote monitoring of inhale  and bronchodilator frequency and location. Trials conclude that such system has the potential  to improve the recognition and treatment of poorly controlled asthma and it could also represent  an important improvement in asthma management, epidemiological research, and public health  surveillance.
