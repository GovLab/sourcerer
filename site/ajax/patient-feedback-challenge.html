		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">The United Kingdom’s National Health Service (NHS) Institute for Innovation and  Improvement created the Patient Feedback Challenge to generate and implement  ideas to improve patient experiences at NHS organizations. Ideas were published  on a web channel, and nine were chosen by an expert panel. Programs were piloted  at nine participating NHS organizations and funded from August 2012 to March  2013, when the NHS Institute was disbanded. The projects were selected following  their bid for a share of the £1 million Challenge fund which was set aside to  support the most promising approaches to measuring and improving patient  experience.

		    <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">More than 2,200 individuals participated in determining the best project ideas  on the Challenge’s web channel. However, the web channel proved to be a challenge  for some participation projects due to technical difficulties with the actual  site and a lack of familiarity with social networking. <br/> Nine NHS projects were ultimately chosen to share the one million pound grant. These nine pilot projects impacted 75 wards, services, and divisions across NHS.
