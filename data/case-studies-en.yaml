   99designs is an online platform that connects graphic designers 
   with potential clients by hosting design challenges.
   <br/>
   The company creates their products by crowdsourcing, as customers can 
   solicit designers to submit designs for contests to create products 
   such as websites, t-shirts, or logos. The customer then chooses the best 
   design from the pool of submitted entries and the selected designer will 
   win a cash payment. Customers also have the option of working with individual 
   designers by purchasing design templates from 99designs’ Readymade logo store 
   or by visiting Swiftly for quick graphic design fixes and steal logo's.

   "Back in 2008, 99designs’ Founder Mark Harbottle locked colleagues Lachlan 
   Donald and Paul Annesley in an office in Melbourne to pioneer a new kind 
   of marketplace for graphic design.
   <br/>
   Mark and Matt Mickiewicz, already co-founders of successful online media 
   and publishing company SitePoint, along with Internet pioneer and entrepreneur 
   Leni Mayo and Melbourne IT Non-Executive Director and ex-CEO of Hitwise, 
   Andrew Walsh, became founding investors in the startup.
   <br/>
   Upon launch, 99designs quickly caught the eye of small business owners around 
   the world looking for a fast, affordable alternative to the traditional 
   design process. The service was off to a flying start.
   <br/>
   By 2010, the business had opened offices in San Francisco and won the 
   prestigious Webby People's Voice Award for Best Web Service and 
   Application.
   <br/>
   In April 2011, 99designs announced a $35 million Series A investment 
   to assist with its global expansion. This investment round was led by 
   Accel Partners, with participation from angel investors Michael Dearing 
   (eBay, Harrision Metal), Dave Goldberg (Survey Monkey), Stewart Butterfield
   (Flickr, Tiny Speck) and Anthony Casalena (Squarespace).
   <br/>
   In August 2012, 99designs made its first acquisition, purchasing European 
   creative services marketplace 12designer to help fuel its global growth. 
   Following the acquisition and establishment of its European headquarters 
   in Berlin, 99designs launched localized versions of its services in German, 
   French, Spanish, Dutch and Italian.
   <br/>
   This global expansion continued with the acquisition of LogoChef - one 
   of Brazil's leading design marketplaces - in August 2013.
   <br/>
   That same month, 99designs introduced an entirely different way for 
   businesses to get small design tasks done quickly: Swiftly. The 
   first-of-its-kind service is part of 99designs' broader plan to change 
   the paradigm for how businesses worldwide get graphic design work done 
   and how designers earn money."

  description: >
   Adopt-a-Hydrant is a web application that allows citizens to "adopt" civic
   infrastructure, such as fire hydrants that need to be shoveled out after it
   snows. The Adopt-a-Hydrant program allows residents to go to a website, enter
   an address, and choose a hydrant to shovel from their specified geographic area.
   To motivate residents to volunteer, the program incorporates game dynamics 
   like having the option to name your hydrant, and “steal” ownership of a hydrant
   if the shoveling is not done.

   The project started in 2011 when Erik Michael-Ober was a Code for America 
   Fellow, partnered with the City of Boston. Launched in January 2012, Adopt-a-Hydrant
   is a map-based web app that allows citizens to claim responsibility for shoveling 
   a fire hydrant after a snowstorm. The project was developed by Michael-Ober
   while working in the Boston Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics in partnership
   with the Boston Fire Department It was created in response to firefighters having 
   difficulties quickly accessing, and using, a fire hydrant buried under snow. 
   Residents who shovel their own walkways are not responsible for shoveling 
   hydrants, and the municipality does not have the resources to check and shovel 
   every hydrant between one heavy snowfall and the next.
  output: >
   The City of Boston has over 13,000 fire hydrants, which are mapped.

   1200 people in Boston have signed-up to shovel fire hydrants around the their 
   homes or offices. The open-source code has also been forked and used various 
   other cities to adopt other types of civic infrastructure (e.g. tsunami 
   warning sirens in Honolulu, Hawaii).

   site Hypervocal and (full disclosure) Latoya Peterson’s site, Racialicious,

   reaction to content on a whole page or parts of a page online, encouraging 
   smarter use of information and participation, from shopping to public policy:

   By accepting submissions at every stage, including the idea stage, the 
   Solutions for Stronger Communities competition lowered the barrier for engagement
   for those with potential solutions who lacked the capital or expertise to put 
   their solutions into action. However, this low barrier to entry could also delay 
   the impact of contest winners, since entries could take a significant amount of 
   time and capital to operationalize.

   The Consumer Complaint Database launched on June 2013, following the 
   formation of the CFPB in July 2011, which continues to oversee site 
   management. The CFPB was founded as a result of the Dodd–Frank Wall 
   Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which passed in response 
   to the Late-2000s recession and financial crisis. The bureau began 
   operation on July 21, 2011. Congress established the CFPB to protect 
   consumers by carrying out federal consumer financial laws. The CFPB 
   seeks to ensure that consumers get the information they need to make 
   the financial decisions they believe are best for themselves and their 
   families, that prices are clear up front, that risks are visible and 
   that nothing is buried in fine print. The agency has the power to write 
   rules, supervise companies, and enforce federal consumer financial 
   protection laws; restrict unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices; 
   take consumer complaints; promote financial education; research consumer 
   behavior; monitor financial markets for new risks to consumers; and 
   enforce laws that outlaw discrimination and other unfair treatment in 
   consumer finance.

   Drive BC offers nothing in the way of metrics regarding the use and impact 
   of the site. However, the citizen reporting option’s placement on a central 
   Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure web page makes it likely that 
   citizen input will continue to increase and inform government operations. 
   The Twitter account’s 17,600 followers demonstrate its reach and scope.
  impact_longer_term:
  challenges: >
   Drive BC’s citizen reporting functionality does not feature any on-site 
   means of citizen input. For all issues, citizens are directed to contact 
   information, notably telephone numbers, with no option for simply typing 
   in a description of the issue and the address directly from the Web or 
   mobile. While this capability exists using the DriveBC Twitter account, 
   it is questionable whether citizens would ascertain this fact from visiting 
   the desktop or mobile Drivebc.ca site.
   <br/>
   Drive BC’s ability to guide citizen input regarding issues on different 
   types of provincial roads and highways, as well as wildfires, chemical 
   spills and downed power lines could go unnoticed by citizens because the 
   link to report such issues is subtly presented on the site. Moreover, 
   the link citizens need to click, on mobile or desktop, is confusingly 
   labeled “Report a Highway Problem.” Based on this subtlety and misleading 
   label, citizens attempting to report a wildfire or a pothole on a municipal 
   road could easily assume that Drive BC is not the correct place to make 
   such a report.

   The project was launched in 2012 under the name Microryza by two University of 
   Washington graduates, Denny Luan and Cindy Yu, seeking to understand how the 
   Internet could be used to help fund scientific projects that are left behind by 
   the traditional grant funding model. The site relaunched as Experiment.com 
   in February 2014.
   <br/>
   Researchers submit their projects via the platform to be reviewed by the 
   Experiment team. After being approved, the project is uploaded in the 
   webpage. The researchers then share their projects to gain awareness and 
   crowdfund it. If the project reaches its funding goal, in the established 
   deadline, the money is transferred from the crowdfunders to the researchers. 
   Rather than provide funders with perks, a traditional part of crowdfunding, 
   funders of projects crowdfunded through Experiment get access to discussions 
   around the experimental process.

  url: http://fold.it/portal/
  description: > 
   Foldit is a online-based puzzle game, where participants engage in simulated 
   protein folding in order to predict protein structure.
   <br/>
   Predicting the lowest energy state of a protein is a task computers are poor at, 
   but people are good at. Foldit is an attempt to gamify the process of predicting 
   protein structures to crowdsource the data-gathering.
   <br/>
   Foldit is the creation of biochemist, David Baker, and game designer, Zoran 
   Popovic, both of whom work at the University of Washington in Seattle. The game 
   is downloaded onto a player’s personal computer and then allow the player to 
   manipulate protein structures.
   <br/>
   There are a series of levels a player moves through, with the earliest levels 
   acting as training rounds, where players work on already-known proteins in 
   order to learn the basics of protein folding skills. The game involves a 
   point-system, where the highest number of points are awarded to those with proteins
   that have been manipulated to have the lowest-energy configurations.
   <br/>
   As described in an article by the Scientific American website, “The Foldit 
   exploration puzzle game attempts to predict the structure of a protein by 
   taking advantage of our puzzle-solving intuitions and having people play 
   competitively to fold the best proteins. Players can also design brand new 
   proteins that could help prevent or treat important diseases.”

   David Baker, a biochemist at the University of Washington, designed Foldit 
   with the help of Zoran Popovic, a computer scientist also at the University 
   of Washington, and David Salesin. The idea to develop Foldit came from the 
   Rosetta@Home program, a distributed computing project designed to predict 
   the structure of proteins. Rosetta@Home works with the help of millions of 
   computers that have the program installed and that help process the information 
   of the structure of particular proteins. This information is displayed in the 
   form of a screensaver to each individual computer. David Baker realized 
   that users could not only help by downloading the program but also by helping 
   the program design the structure of the proteins. The three of them decided 
   that the best way to incentivize people to participate in figuring out the 
   structure of proteins was developing a game, where proteins could be folded 
   in different ways minimizing the space between each piece, just like in Tetris.
   In May, 2008 the beta version of the video game was released to the public.

   As of January 2012, Foldit had 240,000 registered users, and the Foldit 
   application was available for PC, Mac, and Linux.

   Foldit has the potential to help advance cures for serious diseases such 
   as AIDS. According to a September 2011 Time Magazine blogpost, “Gamers 
   playing a protein-folding game called Foldit have helped unlock the structure 
   of an AIDS-related enzyme that the scientific community had been unable 
   to unlock for a decade.”

   Headquartered in San Francisco, GroupTalent is a hiring platform that lists 
   contract-for-hire opportunities so a developer can try out working with a 
   company before they commit to a longer-term job.
   <br/>
   If you are an employer seeking a programmer, a company pays GroupTalent to 
   list the job opportunity on the platform. Using an algorithm, GroupTalent 
   then matches the listing description with actively-looking programmers who 
   are registered on GroupTalent after being vetted by the platform’s staff. 
   The employer can then invite a programmer for an interview for a 
   contract-to-hire opportunity. At the end of the predefined period of time, 
   the employer can extend an offer for longer-term employment.
   <br/>
   Now based in San Francisco, GroupTalent was developed out of TechStars 
   Seattle and raised $1 million in funding from Version One Ventures, Menlo

- title: I Paid a Bribe
  url: http://www.ipaidabribe.com
  description: >
   Janaagraha is a non-profit that works for improving the quality of 
   citizenship and infrastructure and services in India’s cities. Janaagraha 
   runs two on-line platforms, ICHangeMyCity.com and IPaidABribe.com. 
   IPaidABribe.com is a platform provided to citizens to crowd source bribe 
   experiences. It is a citizen driven mechanism for tracking bribe payment 
   activity, also instances of when people resisted bribe payments or did 
   not have to pay bribes because of good government systems or good people 
   within the government systems. Citizens’ reports on the nature, number, 
   pattern, types, locations and frequency of actual corrupt acts and values 
   of bribes will add up to a valuable knowledge bank that will contribute 
   to a reduction in bribe payments.
   <br/>
   By providing a place for citizens to report, as well as by analyzing the 
   information, ipaidabribe.com aims to
   * Heighten citizen awareness about the nature and spread of bribe-related 
   exchanges and promote a purposive public debate that pressurises public 
   officials to reduce and eventually eliminate corruption.
   * Help citizens to recognize, avoid and tackle bribe paying situations.
   * Identify and analyse the workflows within corruption prone public services, 
   to make suggestions on systemic reform directed at entrenching simpler and 
   more transparent processes, more consistent standards of law enforcement 
   and better vigilance and regulation.

   The ipaidabribe.com idea has emerged and evolved over time. It commenced 
   with a discussion between co-founders of Janaagraha, Swati and Ramesh 
   Ramanathan and Mr. Sridar Iyengar, a board member of Janaagraha’s advisory 
   board a couple of years back regarding the pernicious effect of corruption 
   on destroying city life and disempowering citizens. The original idea was 
   that the website could become a simple means of tracking the market price 
   of corruption - a kind of market price prediction mechanism. A small 
   experimental website was put up to test the idea. However the afterthought 
   was that such an effort was indeed a very powerful one. Over time, we worked 
   on the idea extensively and added a lot more features. We decided that the 
   website has to be a multifaceted site, providing a variety of services to 
   people. We launched the new completely redesigned website on Aug 15, 2010, 
   India’s Independence day. 
   <br/>
   IPaidABribe.com (IPAB) is an initiative to tackle corruption by tapping 
   into the collective energy of citizens, almost every one of whom is either 
   a victim, perpetrator or beneficiary, or a combination of these. Janaagraha 
   has a very rigorous system of aligning its institutional objectives with 
   the performance of its programmes. Each institutional objective is further 
   aligned with several strategic themes. Ipab aligns with Janaagraha’s goal 
   of making a measurable difference in the quality of Citizenship in cities. 
   It does this by adopting the strategy of empowering citizens using a 
   net-plus- roots approach – we use a net based platform for recording the 
   grassroots experiences of citizens. Through this approach, ipaidabribe.com 
   aligns completely with Janaagraha’s key thrust of increasing the number of 
   citizen change agents in the city. We believe that every citizen who reports 
   a story on our website about paying a bribe, is angry enough to begin to 
   resist it. Of course, it goes without saying that somebody who has resisted 
   paying a bribe and reported the story, is already very much on the path of 
   being a citizen change agent.

   to make suggestions on systemic reform directed at entrenching simpler and 
   more transparent processes, more consistent standards of law enforcement 
   and better vigilance and regulation.
   Summarising the above, the three fold impact strategy of the platform 
   covers three broad strands 
   a) Education. Through How To's and information, make citizens aware 
   of the government procedures so that bribes are not paid through ignorance. 
   b) Policy Reform. Use of data collected and trend analysis to plug the avenues 
   of corruption.
   c) Redressal. Escalate individual reports to the authorities and department 
   heads who can initiate enquiries/ legal proceedings against the accused.
  impact_today: >
   A legal impact can be seen only if legal complaints increase and prosecutions 
   happen. Right now, we are engaging in creating a groundswell against corruption, 
   both working with the government to reduce red tape as also with citizens to 
   build up their courage and helping them to overcome corruption. We believe that 
   corruption has grown this big only because as citizens, we have tolerated it. 
   If we actively oppose it and there are enough of us, the government has to 
   buckle down and tackle the problem effectively. To do that, it is also important 
   that we build bridges with and support the actions of honest officials within the 
   government, who often look the other way, because they are dispirited and become 
   cynical. 
   <br/>
   The Transport Commissioner in Bangalore called to communicate his embarrassment 
   at finding his department having the highest instances of bribe taking in 
   Bangalore. We worked with him and his senior management team to re-engineer the 
   process flow and reduce the loopholes for rent seeking in the issuance of drivers’ 
   licenses, so that 2 key steps that in the past had a fair amount of subjective 
   discretion in them, were converted to automated tests. 
   <br/>
   As another example, the department for land registration used to have designated 
   offices where one had to go to register the purchase and sale of land – depending 
   on where in the city the particular land parcel was, one had to go to a specific 
   Sub Registrar’s Office. With the ipaidabribe.com data, it was evident that there 
   was a flourishing market for bribes in land transactions, reflecting admirably 
   the laws of supply and demand! Those Sub Registrar offices that were on the periphery 
   of the city, where much of the new growth occurs, were seeing thegreatest rates of 
   bribes, whereas those Sub Registrar Offices which were in the heart of the city, 
   where land transactions are less frequent, were seeing fewer touts and lower rates. 
   So we made a proposal to the Department of Stamps and Registration – given that 
   all land transactions had been converted to electronic records, why not make them 
   ‘Anywhere Registration’? That is, one could go to any Sub Registrar office in the 
   city to register one’s land transaction. 
  impact_longer_term: >
   Our intent is to change the system that breeds corruption, rather than indict the 
   individuals within the system. Besides, even if you change the individuals, the 
   threat of corruption still remains. But change the system and you root out 
   corruption permanently. 
   <br/>
   The role that non-government bodies play is multi-fold since corruption is such 
   a vast and hydra-headed monster - from procurement processes in public projects, 
   to extraction of precious natural resources, to public services, and favouritism/ 
   nepotism towards private enterprise – these are all rife with corruption as 
   instruments for wealth and/or power.

   Currently with our net presence alone, we do realize that we only touch people 
   who have access to the net. With the pace of internet penetration in India, 
   this number is likely to grow rapidly. 
   <br/>
   Mobile phone usage in the country is on a surge, we have hence also developed 
   a mobile app to enable people to report their stories via their smart phone. 
   For those who do not have a smart phone, reports can be shared through a bribe 
   hotline, via a call.
   <br/>
   With over 34000 reports on the website, many reports are received from citizens 
   in the major cities (especially the IT hubs of Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chennai). 
   Followed by tier 2 cities in states. 
   <br/>
   While we do get a lot of page views ( consuming the content on the platform) 
   reporting of instances of bribe transactions is still in its nascent stages.

   The biggest challenge for IPaidaBribe.com is to respond to the demands of the 
   public, to provide support and information quickly. As this is a web based 
   initiative, it is important that we respond to people very fast. For this purpose, 
   one needs to collect data from the government, analyse government procedures 
   and present the findings in a simple manner. At any given time, we are undertaking 
   research on at least two to three important government procedures or departments.

   The consultation generated 500 contributions, just over 400 comments in the official
   discussion forum and approximately 100 ideas sent via private email, Twitter and 
   Facebook. The Ideas2Action website provides information on the “125 actions and counting” 
   that were inspired by the citizen consultation period. Some actions include, the creation
   of a Job Trend Tracker for exploring statistics on more than 500 careers, increased 
   outreach to schools and counselors regarding BC Job Fairs and the development of a Cost 
   of Living Calculator for many BC towns.

   Using the title Skills for BC for the discussion portion of the project and 
   Ideas2Action for post-consultation government response, all under the wider 
   umbrella of the BC Jobs Plan, could create confusion. Using the same title for 
   each stage of the initiative would make it easier for citizens to understand the 
   nature of the consultation and to continue their interest and involvement as 
   government continues to act on public suggestions.
   <br/>
   While the consultation period is over, and contact information is available on 
   the site, the continued presence of an ideas-based discussion forum could be valuable, 
   even if relevant government agencies are unable to review or act on any new 
   suggestions for the foreseeable future. Providing an outlet for citizen discussion 
   in this area could prove worthwhile on its own terms.

   The original idea for this crowdsourcing project came from Alph Bingham and 
   Aaron Schacht, coworkers in the pharmaceutical Eli Lilly and Company. Coming 
   from the pharmaceutical industry, Bingham and Schacht had a first hand perspective 
   on the challenge that R&D budgets represent to companies. In the pharmaceutical 
   industry one of their perennial efforts is to improve the cycle time for drug 
   discovery and development. This effort comes with the challenge of reducing the 
   enormous costs that failures in the R&D departments of the pharmaceutical industry 
   represent in monetary terms. 
   <br/>
   Having in mind the particular problems that the pharmaceutical industry faces in
   creating value from their expensive R&D, Bingham and Schach created a prototype of
   the platform in 1998 after collaboratively thinking of ways in which to incorporate 
   Internet into business strategies. In 2001 InnoCentive was launched by Jill Panetta, 
   Jeff Hensley, Darren Carroll, and Alph Bingham. One of the motives behind the creation 
   of this platform for communal work was to enable what the Internet provides: a global 
   marketplace of qualified individuals that can produce faster and cheaper innovation.
  output: >
   As of 2015, InnoCentive reports that their network includes 355,000+
   solvers from nearly 200 countries. More than 2,000 external challenges have

   Kickstarter is a platform to fund creative projects. Individuals and teams that need help
   with funding, post their projects in the Kickstarter platform. Each project must contain 
   the explanation of the story behind the project, it must specify a funding goal and a 
   deadline to achieve it. If the project does not reach the funding goal in the determined 
   time lapse, it does not receive any of the money pledged by the participants. Individuals 
   retain the intellectual property of their projects and Kickstarter charges a 5% fee of 
   the raised funds of any successful project. To encourage individuals to pledge money, each 
   project must offer rewards according to the amount of pledged money. Besides helping projects 
   obtain the funding they need, Kickstarter helps develop community engagement between the
   project and the funders.

   The idea of Kickstarter came to Perry Chen in 2002 when he tried to produce a DJ 
   show in New Orleans. He had found a perfect location and tried to raise the 
   necessary money to stage it but in the end the show did not happen since the 
   amount of money required was too much. Chen was disturbed by the fact that the 
   audience had no decision in the process. He had the idea of developing a site 
   where people could buy tickets in advance or pledge money for projects they were 
   interested in seeing coming to live, if not enough money was raised then people 
   would not be charged. From New Orleans Chen moved to New York where he met Yancey 
   Strickler, co-founder of Kickstarter. With Strickler they brainstormed ideas for 
   the project, then they met Charles Adler, the first designer of the platform, 
   who helped develop the image of the site. In April 28, 2009 they launched the 
   site. The first project posted was of Chen, to pledge money for stenciled t-shirts. 
   In 2011, they reached one million backers and in February 2012, one of the projects 
   in Kickstarter reached the amount of a million dollars in pledges.

   The Australian Government 2.0 Taskforce created Mashup Australia to offer a 
   practical demonstration of the benefits that open access to Australian public 
   sector information (PSI) can provide. By working to establish this contest, 
   the government also provided a practical demonstration of what open access is 
   and does, while identifying some of the barriers that exist within government 
   to a broader adoption of open access to PSI.

   In 2009, from October – November, the Australian government released 59 
   government datasets from 23 local and national agencies for a “hackathon.”
   <br/>
   The Government 2.0 Taskforce was established by the Australian Government 
   in 2009 as a joint initiative between the Hon. Lindsay Tanner MP, Minister 
   for Finance and Deregulation and Senator the Hon. Joe Ludwig, Cabinet 
   Secretary and Special Minister of State.
   <br/>
   The purpose of the Taskforce is to investigate how the Australian Government 
   can increase the openness of government and encourage greater online 
   engagement.
  output: >
   The primary objective of MashupAustralia was to showcase how something as 
   simple as, for example, the locations of government services or census data, 
   can deliver benefits to the research, commercial and community sectors—and 
   to citizens at large.
   <br/>
   The government also hoped to address some of the challenges raised by open 
   access to PSI, and awarded bonuses to entrants that sought to transform, 
   enrich and enhance data sets into more useful and open formats in the process 
   of building their entries.
   <br/>
   Finally, the government also aimed to drive community engagement, an ongoing goal 
   of the Government 2.0 Taskforce.
  impact_today: >
   Of the 82 mashups entered, two won the grand $10,000 prize:
   * Suburban Trends: “A mashup of different types of crime and census data 
   that allows you to compare and contrast suburbs by a range of economic, 
   education, safety and socio-economic indicators. The judges thought the 
   ability to compare suburbs visually combined with the selective choice of 
   statistics was excellent especially in a field dominated by many entries 
   using similar datasets.”
   * Know Where You Live: “This entry bills itself as a prototype of a mashup 
   of a range of open access government data based on postcodes so that you 
   can truly know where you live. The judges loved the very citizen-centric 
   “common questions” user experience of this app and the groovy, and again, 
   selective repackaging of what could otherwise be considered (we’ll be 
   honest here) slightly boring data.”

   The greatest impediment to the program is that Australia lacks a central 
   hub for all challenges, but instead has one-off sites and programs. This 
   compounds other problems, most notably those regarding resource allocation; 
   for example, individual agencies are not empowered to launch their own 
   challenges, and most challenges tend to be short-lived.

   Neighbor.ly is the fundraising toolkit for community projects of Luminopolis. 
   The idea came to Jase Wilson from a series of fortunate circumstances: hearing a talk of Rob 
   Goodspeed about civic crowdsourcing, attending a public meeting to discuss the funding of a 
   streetcar, watching a video game break a record for funding at Kickstarter and a breakfast he had 
   with Patrick Hosty one of the advisors of the site. At this breakfast, Wilson 
   and Hosty where discussing a bond deal when a person overheard their conversation
   and started discussing with them. This person decided not to vote for that particular bond deal
   because it lumped sewer repairs with paying for other civic amenities, like buying new animals
   for the zoo. Hosty and this person got into a heated discussion which gave Wilson the idea
   for the site. The site was thought to fund civic projects one really cared about.

   As part of the discussion that the crowdsourcing model can tap the possibilities 
   for digital communication networks to mobilize citizens, foster creative input 
   and produce plans through democratic processes, which more accurately address 
   our lived experience within organized networks today. A few scholars studying 
   collective intelligence in governance,including Clark and Logan cite the 
   successes of the crowdsourcing platform Ushahidi and of the ideation initiative 
   NYCBigApps as evidence that crowdsourcing can transform government to be more 
   engaging, more democratic, and more effective.
   <br/>
   The Challenge is also a test of the concept of prize-backed challenges, that 
   help create the incentive for insightful enthusiasts to emerge from the 
   woodwork. The use of prizes in the public sector is growing more common, as 
   evidenced by the New York City’s BigApps challenge, although we still do not 
   have a strong understanding of their optimal uses.

   global community in a structured, collaborative process to generate and develop 
   innovative solutions to the world’s toughest problems. Since 2010, OpenIDEO has 
   run 30 online challenges that have engaged over 80,000 people from more than 170 
   countries in designing solutions to issues like youth employment, renewable energy, 
   and women’s safety in urban slums.
   <br/>
   OpenIDEO challenges typically last three months. The process starts with a 
   Research phase, which is an opportunity for the community to share stories, 
   insights and success stories in order to build empathy and more deeply understand 
   the challenge topic before diving into ideas submission. Based on insights gathered
   in the Research phase, the challenge moves into the Ideas phase, where the OpenIDEO 
   community shares ideas representing new approaches and solutions to the issue, and 
   participants work together to build and improve these ideas. At the end of the Ideas 
   phase, a shortlist of 20-25 ideas that have shown the most potential for impact is 
   selected to move to the Refinement phase, where participants focus on prototyping 
   and testing ideas with end users, getting feedback, and refining their ideas. 
   Ultimately, approximately five Top Ideas from the Challenge are announced and 
   featured on the platform. These ideas may be taken forward by anyone in the OpenIDEO 
   community, or may receive various types of implementation support from OpenIDEO and 
   the challenge sponsor.

   The New York City participatory budgeting process has three main goals - inclusion, 
   equality, and empowerment. As their website states, "We also hope that PB will have 
   other benefits for the community: inspiring greater civic participation, building 
   community, educating and empowering residents, increasing transparency in government, 
   and leading to better budget decisions - spending that is more responsible and efficient, 
   and that results in more sustainable and livable neighborhoods.

   The United Kingdom’s National Health Service (NHS) Institute for Innovation and 
   Improvement created the Patient Feedback Challenge to generate and implement 
   ideas to improve patient experiences at NHS organizations. Ideas were published 
   on a web channel, and nine were chosen by an expert panel. Programs were piloted 
   at nine participating NHS organizations and funded from August 2012 to March 
   2013, when the NHS Institute was disbanded. The projects were selected following 
   their bid for a share of the £1 million Challenge fund which was set aside to 
   support the most promising approaches to measuring and improving patient 
   experience.

   More than 2,200 individuals participated in determining the best project ideas 
   on the Challenge’s web channel. However, the web channel proved to be a challenge 
   for some participation projects due to technical difficulties with the actual 
   site and a lack of familiarity with social networking.
   <br/>
   Nine NHS projects were ultimately chosen to share the one million pound grant.
   These nine pilot projects impacted 75 wards, services, and divisions across NHS.
  impact_today: >
   Because funding was time-limited to the closure of the NHS Institute, the long 
   term impacts of the specific NHS Challenge projects is still to be determined. 
   However, the funding provided did enable organizations to have the flexibility 
   to test new approaches to patient-care where they otherwise could not afford 
   to do.
   <br/>
   Ultimately, as a government entity, the NHS Institute is not the final 
   decision-maker in its own resources. In April 2013, the Institute was disbanded. 
   The projects continue, but do not have the same access to NHS Institute resources.
   <br/>
   The United Kingdom’s Office of Public Management, which evaluated the Patient 
   Feedback Challenge from June 2012 to February 2013, concluded that a web portal 
   that allowed projects to share ideas and experiences is beneficial and welcomed 
   by participation parties. Yet, NHS Institute’s untested web channel was fraught 
   with initial technical issues, “leading some to lose faith in it and ultimately 
   fail to use it to its full potential. We suggest that in future programmes, 
   introducing a more straightforward online portal with clear guidance about how 
   to use it and fewer technical glitches, is likely to encourage uptake and use.

   The Peer-to-Patent project captured the importance of getting expertise and 
   information into government to inform policymaking. Peer To Patent is the first
   social-software project directly linked to decision-making by the federal government. 
   It is only one approach in the potential evolution toward more open and 
   collaborative institutions.
   <br/>
   Peer To Patent is a historic initiative by the United States Patent and Trademark 
   Office (USPTO) that opens the patent examination process to public participation for 
   the first time. Peer to Patent is an online system that aims to improve the quality of 
   issued patents by enabling the public to supply the USPTO with information relevant to 
   assessing the claims of pending patent applications.
   <br/>
   An initial pilot examined more than 220 patent applications in the fields of software 
   and business methods. The Peer To Patent project has issued two anniversary reports 
   from the initial pilot and a final report from the initial pilot is pending.
   <br/>
   Other patent offices involved in pilot programs include IP Australia,the Japan Patent 
   Office, and the Korean Intellectual Property Office.The UK Intellectual Property Office 
   announced on November 4, 2010, that it would commence a pilot in 2011 and the pilot 
   commenced on 1 June 2011.

   In 2005, before Facebook and Twitter, New York Law School students and the chair
   of the Research Network, Beth Noveck, designed and later launched Peer to Patent, 
   the first expert network in government, which connected volunteer scientists 
   and technologists to national patent offices to better inform how they decide 
   who gets the twenty year grant of the monopoly right called a patent. They 
   invented the process, technology and the policy by which a closed bureaucracy could 
   open its doors and collaborate with knowledgeable people to do its work better. Time 
   after time, the public was able to dig up quickly the expertise the official could
   not find, enabling him/her to make the final determination informed by citizen 
   participation but subject to the independent law and rules of the patent process. 
   Despite the fact that patent practice had not changed much since Thomas Jefferson 
   began as the first examiner in 1791, under the new Patent Act, passed with near 
   unanimity – Peer to Patent citizen engagement, once an experimental pilot undertaken 
   only with the applying inventor's consent – is now enshrined in law.

   * Peer To Patent attracted more than 2,000 peer reviewers.
   * The first 27 office actions issued during the pilot phase showed use of Peer To 
   Patent submitted prior art in nine rejections.
   * On average, citizen-reviewers contributed 6 hours reviewing each patent application in the pilot.
   * Although USPTO rules permit third-party prior art submissions on pending applications (but only 
   before the applications have been published, or before a notice of allowance is issued, whichever 
   comes first), the average number of prior art submissions on Peer To Patent applications was 2,000 
   times that of standard rule-based submissions.
   * 92% of patent examiners surveyed said they would welcome examining another application with public
   participation, while 73% of participating examiners want to see Peer-to-Patent implemented as a regular 
   office practice.
   * 21% of participating examiners stated that prior art submitted by the Peer To Patent community was 
   "inaccessible" directly to USPTO examiners.
   * Prior art submissions by Peer-to-Patent reviewers were four times as likely to include non-patent

  description: >
   PlaceSpeak is a public consultation platform, mainly for city governments, 
   that features a user verification system that ensures everyone taking part in a 
   consultation project has a connection with the relevant geographic area.
   <br/>
   PlaceSpeak features consultation opportunities split into four central topic 
   categories: government, private sector, community and agency. So while the platform 
   is likely best known for its use by city governments, any member can create a public 
   consultation entry for their organization.
   <br/>
   PlaceSpeak “advances public consultation to a whole new level by enabling evidence-based 
   decision-making by allowing citizens to influence the process in an open, safe, secure 
   and transparent manner.”
   <br/>
   PlaceSpeak requires users to create profiles with verified geographic information to ensure 
   that they only partake in consultation opportunities relevant to them. When signing up, 
   users have the option to receive a notification every time a new opportunity is created in their area.
   <br/>
   On the Explore Topics tab, a Google Map shows currently available consultation projects, which can be
   filtered by their color-coded by their topic area. The page also has featured topics, popular topics
   near the users location, recently added topics and a sidebar allowing users to browse by suggested topics, 
   categories, organizations and popular tags.
   <br/>
   Topic pages feature customizable tabs, which can include an overview; a discussion board; resources, 
   like instructive PDFs or links; notification board; and upcoming events. A “Connect with this topic” 
   button appears at the top of each page. A sidebar shows the number of times the topic profile has been viewed,
   the number of connected participants and the organization’s contact information. Since PlaceSpeak is a 
   customizable platform, topic overviews are not uniform. Some options include links to off-site surveys or 
   sign-up forms, media coverage of the topic or on-site polls. Each page, however, features a module at the 
   top with a Google Map showing where the consultation is based and a bulleted list of “How you can help.”
   <br/>
   As a customizable platform, PlaceSpeak can, in many ways, become whatever is needed for a particular consultation 
   project. The geographic verification system ensures that people engaging with a consultation are in fact from the 
   relevant area.

   Propeller Health is a mobile platform for respiratory health management 
   designed to help patients and their physicians better understand and control 
   respiratory disease to reduce preventable emergency room visits and hospitalizations.
   <br/>
   Propeller applies data to solve one of the most pressing public health concerns 
   – asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) – including sharing data, 
   putting data in the hands of patients, leveraging aggregated and anonymous data and 
   linking health data to place. Through sensors, mobile apps and services, Propeller 
   aims to reduce the cost of care while delivering better quality of life for individuals 
   with chronic respiratory disease. Asthma and COPD diseases are unique in that patients 
   carry their inhalers with them and use them at the time and place when they have symptoms. 
   The sensor is a small device that attaches to the top of the existing inhaler and can
   be used with both rescue and controller medications for tracking symptoms and adherence 
   respectively. The objective data it collects, and the personalized feedback patients get
   as a result, can help them and their physicians to better understand and manage these 
   conditions by tracking how often they use their medication and by setting up medication 
   reminders and alerts.

   People with asthma and COPD are strongly recommended to keep track of their symptoms, 
   triggers and use of medications. However, evidence shows that remembering to update 
   this information is tough for patients and it often becomes an inaccurate and incomplete 
   record of their respiratory health over time. Clinical trials report improved asthma 
   control and decline in day-to-day asthma symptoms associated with remote monitoring of inhale 
   and bronchodilator frequency and location. Trials conclude that such system has the potential 
   to improve the recognition and treatment of poorly controlled asthma and it could also represent 
   an important improvement in asthma management, epidemiological research, and public health 
   surveillance.

   <br/>
   Public lab is an online community where members participate in “civic science” 
   experiments through the creation of different scientific tools, as well as the 
   reporting back of the scientific data collected using those tools. The tools 
   include both hardware and software. The Public Lab organization also provides 
   support for community members through the website.
   <br/>
   There are various Public Lab projects being conducted at any given time. Current 
   tools include: indoor air quality mapping, balloon and kite mapping, home testing 
   for endocrine disruptors, balloon telemetry, and spectrometry.
   <br/>
   Public Lab has used Kickstarter extensively to fund the organization as well as 
   specific projects. If donors contribute a specific amount to one of Public Lab’s 
   Kickstarter campaigns, they receive a kit providing them with all the materials 
   to build a specific piece of equipment to participate in the project. The kits are 
   designed to include materials that are readily available and easy to assemble, so 
   that participants who do not wish to contribute and receive the kit can still 
   build the tools to participate in the project. Additionally, Public Lab is a 501c3 
   non-profit, meaning that it can receive tax-deductible donations.

   Public Lab was inspired by the information blackout surrounding the 2010 BP
   Oil Disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Despite having a massive impact on 
   residents and the environment, local communities received sparse, incomplete 
   data that contradicted what they could see unfolding in front of them. As 
   news of the spill’s severity spread and outrage about limited access to 
   information simmered locally, three of Public Lab’s would-be co-founders, 
   Shannon Dosemagen, Jeff Warren and Stewart Long, convened in the Gulf Coast 
   with a plan to use helium balloons, kites and inexpensive digital cameras to 
   loft their own "community satellites" over the spill. The trio, in partnership 
   with New Orleans-based environmental justice organization, Louisiana Bucket Brigade, 
   trained over one hundred local volunteers and activists who then collected over 
   100,000 aerial images of the coastline before, during, and after the oil spread. 
   Using MapKnitter, an open source platform created by the group, residents stitched 
   these images into high-resolution maps of the disaster. Through a partnership 
   with Google Earth Outreach, these community-created maps were then uploaded to 
   Google Earth making them globally accessible. The maps of the spill received broad 
   media coverage, including being featured by the New York Times, BBC, PBS, and the 
   Boston Globe, allowing residents to speak their truth to the world about what was 
   going on in the Gulf Coast. The success of the grassroots mapping effort galvanized 
   Dosemagen, Warren, and Long, along with other collaborators, to found Public Lab as 
   a new research and social space for the development of cheap tools for community 
   based environmental monitoring and research. With early support from the John S. 
   and James L. Knight Foundation via the Knight New Challenge, the group formally 
   launched Public Lab as a nonprofit organization in summer 2011.

   resuscitation (CPR) and willing to assist in case of an emergency can now be 
   notified if someone nearby is having a cardiac emergency and may require CPR. 
   If the cardiac emergency is in a public place, the location-aware application 
   will alert trained citizens in the vicinity of the need for bystander CPR 
   simultaneous with the dispatch of advanced medical care. The application also 
   directs these citizen rescuers to the exact location of the closest publicly 
   accessible Automated External Defibrillator (AED).

   The Pulse Point mobile application was first launched by the PulsePoint 
   Foundation in April 2010. The original idea for PulsePoint came from Richard 
   Price, former chief of San Ramon Valley Fire Department, in order to connect 
   those who are trained in CPR with those who are in need of emergency cardiac 
   assistance.
   <br/>
   The first edition of the App “did not contain the location-aware CPR/AED 
   notification capability” and was available exclusively through Apple’s App 
   Store within iTunes. Subsequent versions have location awareness features and 
   are available to Android users in addition to Apple users. San Jose, 
   California became the first community to utilize the app in 2012.
   <br/>
   The Pulse Point app is connected with a middle tier website and a dispatch 
   interface, which allows 911 dispatchers to input cardiac emergency information 
   (including location) into the app. The app uses GPS to notify registered users 
   within walking distance (usually about 0.5 miles away, depending on population 
   density) of both the location of the cardiac emergency and also the location 
   of nearby publicly accessible Automated External Defibrillator (AED).

   promotes the exchange of knowledge, while Wikipedia is a repository for 
   information. Whereas Wikipedia attempts to construct neutral, objective articles, 
   Quora allows individuals to offer their own personal perspective on any given issue. 
   Quora’s core function is the exchange of questions and answers: users post questions 
   to the broader Quora community, and these questions can then be answered by any 
   other Quora user with relevant knowledge to share. These answers are then “voted up” 
   or “voted down” by other users. This voting process allows the “best” answers to 
   achieve the widest circulation.

   Quora was founded in June 2009 by Adam D’Angelo and Charlie Cheever, and was 
   rolled out to the general public in June 2010. Both D’Angelo and Cheever were 
   employed at Facebook prior to the launch of Quora. The company was initially 
   financed by an $11 million investment from Benchmark Capital, a Venture Capital 
   firm specializing in tech-based startups (other recipients of Benchmark 
   investments include Instagram, Zipcar, Yelp, and Twitter). Quora currently has 
   102 employees, and has not yet monetized its service, choosing instead to 
   continue relying on outside investors. On 4/9/14, Quora received an additional 
   $80 million in funding, spearheaded by private equity firm and hedge fund Tiger 
   Global. Multiple sources have reported that Quora will likely turn to advertising 
   to generate revenue by 2015.

   Quora has become one of the most popular Q&A platforms and has attracted a number 
   of notable celebrities, including Ashoton Kutcher, Mark Zuckerberg, and President 
   Obama. It has carved out a niche among social networking sites; by focusing on a 
   Q&A format, it continues to promote the exchange of information, and not simply 
   encourage social interaction. Quora’s essential value proposition, making it 
   easier for people to seek out and/or share specific human knowledge, is ultimately 
   difficult to quantify. It is safe to say however, that Quora has enabled people 
   to solicit the wisdom of highly specialized experts, and made it easier for people 
   with specific knowledge to share what they know.

   From a business perspective, Quora’s most significant challenge in the near 
   future will be monetizing its business and beginning to generate revenue. 
   To date, the company has relied exclusively on outside investment to finance 
   its operations. Quora will likely choose to monetize its site through advertising; 
   transitioning to an advertising-based model while not disrupting the user 
   experience will be a challenge for the company.
   <br/>
   Observers have offered a number of criticisms of Quora’s functionality 
   and culture:
   * Some have argued that Quora is dominated by an elite of early adopters, 
   who punish dissenting voices by downgrading their answers and through 
   bullying tactics.
   * Others have argued that Quora’s core Q&A format, though fantastic as 
   a research tool or as a way to share knowledge, is inherently less scale-able 
   than purely social platforms like Facebook or Twitter. People habitually make 
   use of these social networking sites, but are likely to turn to Quora only for 
   more specific needs.
   * Other users have criticized Quora’s policy of requiring smartphone users to 
   view Q&A threads through their mobile app, and not allowing access through 
   browsers.
   * In August 2012, Ivan Kirigin criticized Quora on his blog, Giant Robot 
   Lasers, pointing out that Quora published information on which questions users 
   viewed. Kirigin argued that this practice constituted a major invasion of 
   privacy, “What if the question were ‘How can I cope with newly discovered 
   cancer?’ Or, ‘Should I come out to my parents?’ Or, ‘What is the best way 
   to hide an affair?’” To Quora’s credit, it responded by discontinuing 
   this practice.

   Alexey Navalny is a Russian lawyer, stock trader and political activist. He 
   founded RosPil in 2010 to continue in a more organized manner the personal 
   enterprise he has been doing since 2007 of exposing cases of corruption in big 
   state-owned enterprises. Navalny began doing this in sight of his own financial 
   interests since he became owner of a considerable amount of stocks from three 
   big state-owned companies: Rosneft, Gazprom, and Transneft. After receiving 
   small returns on the investments he had made, he started taking a more active 
   role by investigating the management of these companies. He stumbled one day 
   with a news article about a big donation carried out by Transneft to a number 
   of charitable organizations. After unsuccessfully trying to find out which 
   institutions received the donation, he asked the most important charitable institutions
   if they had received part of the aforementioned money. Since none of them 
   had received any money from Transneft he decided to file a criminal investigation 
   to find out the destination of the money that was supposedly donated. The case 
   made little progress over four years and was finally dropped. After finding out 
   more cases of corruption in the managerial aspects of state-owned companies, 
   Navalny opened a blog in 2007 to expose these cases. This blog received 
   considerable interest from the public. After starting to receive leads from more 
   possible cases of corruption from individuals who read his blog he decided to 
   open RosPil in 2010.

   One of RosPil’s good practices is the triple process of crowdsourcing they practice to run their project. 
   1)	They rely on a crowd to inform them of suspicious tender processes. 
   2)	After making a preliminary analysis of the terms of draft of the procurement process, they ask a 
   crowd of specialists about the particular technical requirements of that procurement process 
   in order to corroborate if it is plausible to have a bid under the conditions stated in the contract. 
   3)	They obtain their financial resources by crowdfunding.

   "Safecast is a global sensor network for collecting and sharing radiation 
   measurements to empower people with data about their environments." The 
   organization crowdsources expertise and uses a citizen science model to 
   collect their data. 
   <br/>
   Safecast deploys teams of volunteers to record nuanced data such as 
   radiation counts per minute, raw levels of radiation, becquerels, and 
   microsieverts, which together tell a complete story about radiation levels. 
   Volunteers strap Safecast’s custom ‘bento box’ (referred to as such due to 
   their resemblance to bento boxes) Geiger counters to their vehicles and 
   collect radiation data in their communities. Volunteers also use handheld 
   Geiger counters to collect data on foot.
   <br/> 
   Safecast’s fine-grained data collection methodology is particularly 
   valuable because radiation data levels can vary widely across a single city. 
   Safecast volunteers collect data street by street and at multiple points 
   within a single zone, which creates a more nuanced portrait of actual 
   radiation levels within a region. November 10, 2011. Radiation levels 
   can even differ between neighborhoods, thus rendering city-level data 
   only valuable in ascertaining an approximation of radiation levels 
   city-wide. Collecting data at the neighborhood-level ensures the data 
   is fine-grained and it provides an accurate profile of threats.

   Founded in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi meltdown, Safecast was 
   created to provide fine-grained radiation data to regions impacted by the 
   nuclear power plant meltdown. Two years later, the volunteer-run organization 
   is still leveraging the power of crowdsoucing to provide post-Fukushima 
   radiation data, but has broadened its scope to provide baseline radiation data 
   and also measure other environmental factors like air quality. Due to the scale 
   of the disaster in Fukushima, the majority of the organization’s efforts are 
   still directed at providing granular radiation data so that those impacted by 
   the meltdown can make data-driven decisions.
   <br/>
   In the aftermath of the 9.0 magnitude earthquake and subsequent meltdown at 
   the Fukushima nuclear power plant, there was little publicly available data about 
   radiation levels in Japan. This dearth of radiation data concerned friends Sean 
   Bonner, Pieter Franken, and Joi Ito, all of whom had close ties to the region. 
   Geiger counters that enable radiation data collection were in short supply and 
   little official information about radiation levels was being shared with the 
   public. Spurred by the gap in readily available radiation data and the short 
   supply of Geiger counters, Bonner, Franken, and Ito took it upon themselves to 
   build the hardware they needed to monitor radiation levels in Japan. In 
   partnership with Tokyo Hackerspace, Safecast designed and built high quality 
   Geiger counters to enable citizens to collect radiation data within their 
   communities.
   <br/> 
   Constructing the hardware was one element of Safecast’s work. The other 
   component was assembling an expert network to help monitor the situation 
   unfolding in Japan. Within a week of the Fukushima disaster Safecast mobilized 
   a crowdsourced team of 25 experts committed to voluntarily monitor radiation 
   levels across Japan. This network quickly ballooned to include experts from 
   around the world, and Safecast rapidly grew to become the largest citizen 
   science monitoring network of its kind. This rapid growth can be attributed 
   to a number of factors, but most notably, it was the dearth of official 
   information on radiation levels that led to citizens creating their 
   own crowdsourced network.

   platforms for citizens in New Haven that wanted to report non-emergency issues. 
   Ben Berkowitz on of the cofounders of SeeClickFix had the idea to create the 
   platform after trying to get some graffiti of the wall of his neighbour’s building. 
   After talking with him and realizing he was not going to offer much help, 
   Berkowitz decided to call the city hall to have the problem fixed. Various of 
   his calls went unanswered and out of his frustration the idea of creating a platform 
   to report non-emergency issues came to his mind. If citizens could upload photos 
   of city problems that needed to get fixed, then the government could be held 
   accountable. Some of his cofounders had similar frustrations regarding the delivery 
   of social service and decided to create the platform. The platform is open so any 
   individual can post problems in their own communities. They also have partnered 
   with multiple local governments to create personalized versions of the app and have 
   created a platform so media partners can engage with their community through the website.

   option exists for users to simply create a second entry on the issue, spreading 
   the comments and up-votes on the issue across two or more entries could dilute 
   influence.

   Spacehive is the first Civic Crowdfunding platform, allowing communities to raise 
   money for specific public use neighborhood projects. Created in December 2011, 
   Spacehive has provided a platform for over 230 civic initiatives in the United 
   Kingdom.
   <br/> 
   Spacehive is a United Kingdom-based civic crowdfunding platform that allows 
   citizens to contribute to neighborhood improvement projects. A first of its kind, 
   the Spacehive platform allows anyone to pitch an idea and request community support. 
   In return, community members can pledge funding. If the project funding target is 
   reached, the project gets the green light.
   <br/>
   The critical component of a project on Spacehive is that the proposal is for a 
   public space, i.e. the community can access freely. Online proposals must include 
   a description of the project, an explanation of how the money will be used to meet 
   project goals, and a pitch on why the project is needed. Examples include Christmas 
   decorations on a town bridge that were previously cut for austerity measures, 
   launching a free WiFi zone at a local mall, and a campaign to save a community theater 
   company.
   <br/>
   There are no fees to post and donate to the project. However, Spacehive charges an 
   administrative fee if a project fits its fundraising goal. According to the 
   Spacehive website, these administrative fees total 3.7% on the first 500,000 
   pounds raised, 2.5% on the next 500,000 pounds, and 1.5% thereafter. Current project 
   goals range from 90 pounds to more than 600,000 pounds.

   Stack Exchange is an information exchange platform founded by Jeff Atwood and 
   Joel Spolsky. Users can ask questions on a given topic, and receive crowd-vetted 
   answers.
   <br/> 
   Stack Exchange is a network of expert Q&A communities, each categorized by a 
   specific professionalized field. As of July 2014, there are 125 Q&A sites within 
   the Stack Exchange Network, with subjects as varied as programming to cooking. 
   On each discrete topic site, any user can ask a question, to which the community 
   submits answers. The community ranks the answers that are the best fit for the 
   question, so the answer with the most votes becomes the most visible, and the 
   least applicable answer is voted down. The questions and answers can also be 
   amended by the community, wiki-style.
   <br/>
   The Stack Exchange community is self-governed. Governance is based on site 
   reputation. Reputation is earned by other community members voting on that users 
   previous activity. A user gains more rights as their reputation builds. Rights 
   include deleting, editing, and running for moderator, an elected individual who 
   has increased access to managing a Q&A site.

   Stack Exchange evolved from Stack Overflow, a Q&A platform designed for the 
   software programming community that was launched on September 15, 2008 by 
   Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky.
  output: >
   As of July 2014 the Q&A sites support over 3.5 million users, 8 million 
   questions, and 15 million answers. According to co-founder Joel Spolsky, 
   90-95% of questions asked on the site have answers labeled as reputable.
   <br/>
   In addition, there are 574 unpublished sites - labeled “Area 51” sites - 
   that have been proposed by a member of the community but have not yet proven 
   their ability to amass experts willing to be active.
   <br/>
   The process to become a Stack Exchange site is extensive. If an individual 
   or community is interested in launching a new topic for a Q&A site, they 
   first need to provide examples of questions that would likely be proposed on 
   that site to indicate a defined community. The topic also needs to have a 
   community of experts committed to participating in the information exchange, 
   which is done through signing a petition. Community managers at Stack Exchange 
   gauge the likelihood of activity for the Area 51 site by the individuals who 
   sign the petition. If there are a number of individuals who show a history 
   of activity on Stack Exchange, the site will be approved. However, the site 
   initially be open only to those individuals who signed the petition to populate 
   the platform with enough useful questions and answers so there is already 
   information available when the site is open to the public.
  impact_today: >
   The Stack Exchange Network provides responsive and high-quality answers to 
   specific questions. While only a handful of individuals will ask and answer 
   questions on the site, thousands will be able to view the information 
   exchange. This is a mutual benefit, where active users participate in expanding 
   shared knowledge base, while passive users still garner answers to their questions.
   <br/>
   Much of the success of Stack Exchange Q&A sites can be attributed to the 
   professionalized fields the sites encompass. By tapping into a network of 
   professionals and hobbyists with a shared knowledge and vested interest in 
   exchanging information in their field, the number of quality questions asked and 
   credible answers received increases.

   Launched in 2009, the Open Translation Project was initially seeded with 300 
   translations in 40 languages, with translators in cities across the globe. While 
   the initial translations were completed by professionals, all future translations 
   will be completed by volunteers. In order to ensure quality of translations, TED 
   provides an approved, professional English transcript for every talk, upon which 
   all volunteer translations are based. Before a translation is published, it must 
   be reviewed by a second translator fluent in the language. Translations can be 
   continually improved via a feedback mechanism embedded in the site.
  output: >
   The Open Translation Project has currently produced 62,008 translations in 105 
   different languages, written by 17,565 translators.

   TopCoder is a digital open innovation platform that provides companies and 
   enterprises with access to global talent instantly to develop innovative software 
   applications within a distributive innovation system.
   <br/>
   TopCoder is the world’s largest platform for digital open innovation. It provides 
   a community of hundreds of thousands of software developers, algorithmists and 
   digital designers a way to accelerate the development of new products and services 
   by launching a specialized competition – through a prized-based business model – where 
   companies and enterprises get highly trained experts working in their projects.
   <br/>
   The solutions created by the TopCoder community of experts are delivered through 
   highly scalable processes overseen by TopCoder and clients themselves provide 
   guidance and feedback through the entire process of software development from 
   concept, designs and build to delivery, enhancement and maintenance of digital 
   offerings in support of their different products and services.
   <br/>
   According to Professor Karim Lakhani, the incentives for the expert community 
   to participate in TopCoder are heterogeneous ranging from the monetary incentive, 
   having a sense of community, the learning from the process and just for the fun 
   of it. Having people participating with different motivations is important for 
   the resilience of the platform.

   Ushahidi, which means “testimony” in Swahili, was originally developed by an 
   ad hoc group of volunteers in January 2008 to help map reports of violence following 
   the Kenyan election. It all originated with a blogpost request by Ory Okolloh, a 
   famous blogger and lawyer from Kenya, who had to leave the country as a result of the 
   violence acts that broke from the 2007 election. Okolloh asked if there were a group 
   of techies willing to develop a platform to report violence and destruction acts in 
   real time using Google Maps, since she believed that government and media were 
   underreporting the number of deaths that were taking place. After the blog was posted
   a two day mashup took place and from there Ushahidi resulted. Since the platform had 
   more than 45,000 registered users the founders of Ushahidi decided to develop a platform 
   that could be used by anyone around the world to report and map real time situations. 
   The Ushahidi platform has been used for citizen reporting in various natural disaster 
   situations and in political conflicts, like in the earthquakes of Haiti and Chile. 
   Six year after its creation, Ushahidi founded iHub, an innovation hub for the technology 
   community in Nairobi. They also helped implement the Making all Voices Count Challenge, 
   a fund that helps to scale up projects that seek to engage citizen participation towards 
   effective governance and accountability in Asia and Africa.

   We the People was launched on September 22, 2011 by the Obama administration. 
   The platform was designed to provide Americans with a new mechanism to submit 
   petitions to the Government regarding various issues.  In its first months of 
   operation, the threshold that a petition needed to reach in order to obtain an
   official response was of 5,000 signatures. Because of the quick and high rate 
   of participation in the portal the signature threshold was raised to a 100,000 
   signatures. The first official response to a petition created on We the People 
   was given one month after the launching of the site, and responded to a petition 
   to reduce the burden of student loans. In 2012, the source code for We the 
   People was published making it available for people all around the world who 
   wish to implement their own petitioning platform. The most popular content on

   Office of Management & Budget, issued a directive for agency heads and 
   departments to implement principles of transparency, participation, and 
   collaboration with the public. The memorandum put forth 3 requirements that 
   agencies had to abide by: publish government information online, improve 
   quality of government information, create and institutionalize a culture of 
   open government, and create an enabling policy framework for open government. 
   Within these guidelines he included deadlines, and a framework for which each 
   agency must adopt an open government plan.

   The Dominican Republic is one of the few countries in the world to have 
   institutionalized through its Constitution participatory budgeting (PB), a 
   process in which non-elected citizens participate in the decision-making process 
   of budget allocation. The ICT4Gov program promotes the use of ICT as a means 
   to reinforce the inclusiveness and transparency of participatory budgeting processes 
   in the country, starting with two pilots in the Municipality of Bani and Jarabacoa. 
   Furthermore, working central government agencies and a broad coalition of national 
   stakeholders, ICT4Gov is currently developing a mobile enabled citizen feedback 
   mechanism to promote accountability and better delivery of public services. 
  output:     
  impact_today: 
   In Democratic Republic of Congo, as of 2012, over 250,000 text messages have been sent 
   throughout the different stages of this project. Since the beginning of the program, the provincial 
   Kivu government reports an increasing capacity of the local government to better allocate resources, 
   and communities involved have already seen an increase in the transfer of funds from the provincial 
   to the local level. The preliminary results of an external evaluation suggest a reduction of tax 
   evasion at the local level, with citizens more willing to pay taxes as they link government spending 
   to improvement in the delivery of services. For the first time, communities such as Ibanda have gone 
   from not having any investment budget to having 40% of their budget devoted to investments. The increase 
   in the transfer of funds from the provincial to the local level has benefited communities, which now 
   have more resources to deliver public services to the poor. For instance, the process has enabled 
   the repair of 54 classrooms and a bridge in Luhindja, the founding of a health center and repair of 
   a sewage system in Bagira, and the construction of a water fountain, as well as toilets in the local 
   markets of Ibanda.To enhance these efforts, ICT4Gov is using mobile phones for four purposes. The 
   first is to invite citizens to the participatory budgeting assemblies through geo-targeted SMS 
   messages. These messages, reaching all the phones receiving signal from a particular tower, announce 
   the date, time and location of the assemblies. Mobile phones are also being used for voting, allowing
   citizens to text a number associates with a particular project to identify which of the priorities they
   would like to see addressed in their community. When they have reached an agreement the local 
   government devotes a percentage of the local investment budget to the project selected by the citizens.
   Additionally, mobile phones are being used to announce the voted decision, making the process more 
   transparent and inclusive than ever before. Finally, mobile phones are being used to ask citizens 
   about the projects that had been chosen. Through text messages, citizens are able to offer feedback 
   and monitor the projects. By instituting a participatory budgeting initiative that uses simple 
   SMS, rather than more advanced computing technologies, the World Bank and the Republic of Congo 
   have been able to engage a larger portion of the population—women in particular.

   spawned over $100 million in development efforts by contestants—likely played 
   a significant role in catalyzing the wider use of price-induced contests and 
   challenges. XPRIZEs have “facilitated an oil recovery cleanup at quadruple the

   <br/>
   The Zooniverse website connects volunteers, or “zooites,” to a variety of 
   Citizen Science Alliance’s projects. The original project, Galaxy Zoo, had 
   volunteers classify galaxies by leading them through on online tutorial of 
   visual cues to determine galaxy type, testing the participant’s newly acquired 
   skills with a trial, and finally having the participants apply this knowledge 
   to unclassified galaxies. While the original Galaxy Zoo project is archived, 
   there have been several variations including two that are still in progress, 
   Galaxy Zoo, Hubble and Moon Zoo.
   <br/>
   In addition to Galaxy Zoo and its spin-offs, there are many other projects 
   that deal with astronomical categorization using the same technique of training 
   volunteers to identify certain characteristics and then use that knowledge to 
   classify specific celestial objects (galaxies, moons, etc.). The same model 
   is also utilized for projects in other fields such as ecology, climate science, 
   and marine biology. In the case of marine biology, the model was adjusted for a 
   project entitled Whale FM so that participants learned audio instead of visual 
   cues. There are also multiple transcription projects currently underway, 
   including Old Weather and Ancient Lives, which rely on volunteers to transcribe 
   documents.
   <br/>
   The Zooniverse/Citizen Science Alliance team determines which projects will 
   be housed in Zooniverse by having scientists submit proposals through online 
   questionnaires. Zooniverse works with scientists and scholars from a wide 
   variety of fields, including astronomy, humanities, climate science, planetary 
   science, classics, and ecology.

   Zooniverse was launched on August 19, 2009 after the success of the Galaxy Zoo 
   platform. It was designed to host the Galaxy Zoo project and a series of citizen 
   science projects on its interface. Zooniverse intends to provide a home for 
   Citizen Science in the web. With the launching of the site, the Citizen Science 
   Alliance was also launched. The three projects believe in the power of online 
   distributed communities as a key element in the endeavor of advancing  scientific 
   research and further the people’s knowledge of the scientific process.

   There are 22 projects which Zooniverse has run or is currently running. The 
   original Galaxy Zoo project produced millions of classifications. Each of 
   Zooniverse’s projects produces publications based on their findings, which 
   are available to users through the website.
